my echo loved it sometimes while playing a game you can answer a question correctly but alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you i like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home i have had a lot of fun with this thing my 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs i control the lights and play games like categories has nice sound when playing music as well music i received the echo as a gift i needed another bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible and found this smart speaker ca nt wait to see what else it can do without having a cellphone i can not use many of her features i have an ipad but do not see that of any use it is a great alarm if u r almost deaf you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room so that is reason enough to keep herit is fun to ask random questions to hear her response she does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet i think this is the one i ve purchased i m working on getting one in every room of my house i really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all echos and controlling the lights throughout my house looks great love it i ve listened to songs i have nt heard since childhood i get the news weather information its great i sent it to my dad and he talks to it constantly i love it learning knew things with it eveyday still figuring out how everything works but so far its been easy to use and understand she does make me laugh at times i purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she didshe enjoys all the little and big things it can doalexa play this song what time is it and where and how to cook this and that love love love just what i expected i love it wife hates it really happy with this purchase great speaker and easy to set up we have only been using alexa for and are having a lot of fun with our new toy it like having a new household member we are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it we love the size of the generation echo still needs a little improvement on sound i liked the original echo this is the same but shorter and with greater fabriccolor choices i miss the volume ring on top now its just the plusminus buttons not a big deal but the ring w as comforting   other than that well i do like the use of a standard usb charger port instead of the previous round pin other than that i guess it sounds the same seems to work the same still answers to alexaechocomputer so what s not to like   love the echo and how good the music sounds playing off it alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on spotify she is good with amazon music but is lacking in other major programs we love alexa we use her to play music play radio through itunes play podcasts through anypod and set reminders we listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning we rely on our custom lists we like being able to voice control the volume were sure well continue to find new usessometimes its a bit frustrating when alexa does nt understand what were saying have only had it set up for still adding smart home devices to it the speaker is great for playing music i like the size we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and its not intrusive to look at i love it it plays my sleep sounds immediately when i ask i got a unit for the bedroom i was expecting the sounds to be improved but i did nt really see a difference at all overall not a big improvement over generation amazing product i love my echo its easy to operate loads of funit is everything as advertised i use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test alexas knowledge sounds great love them fun item to play with and get used to using sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask but i think it will be better just like the other one still learning all the capabilitiesbut so far pretty pretty pretty good i like it she works well needs a learning command for unique owners and users like alexa learn tashas birthday or alexa learn my definition of fine etc other than that she is great the speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy i bought and the reason i only rate it a is i have followed the instructions for synching music to both units i know i ve done it correctly but they wo nt sync that was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units this device is awesome i bought this to compare the speaker quality to our generation speaker and i like the sound better i will ship this to my daughter though because i like the fact that my generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now love my echo still learning all the things it will do was nt able to follow instructions included in the package but found a great one on utube speaker is better than generation echo this thing is way cool you should get one if you want to be cool that is this is my first digital assistant so i m giving this a good review speaker is really good for the cheap price on prime day fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock that s what i was going to get in the place but i ended up with echo if you have nt had a go with one then definitely try itwhat i like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with my purchase came with a smart plug for 10 which i connect my lamp to alexa turn of the lights my husband likes being able to use it to listen to music i wish we knew all its capabilities my android would not allow alexa to connect fortunately my sister was here with her apple cell after an hour tech support fixed the glitches we are up and running so far so good tried to play certain broadway shows like and it gives ne the group great very satisfied with the echo alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to jimmy buffet by just asking alexa its like siri in fact siri answers more accurately then alexa i do nt see a real need for it in my household though it was a good bargain on prime day deals love my echo still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun i love you so much no different than apple to play a specific list of music you must have an amazon of spotify plusprimeetc account so you must pay to play your music 3 stars for that reason everything else is    excelente lo unico es que no esta en espanol i m still learning how to use it but so far my echo is great the sound is actually much better than i was expecting works as you d expect and then some also good sound quality considering price on sale and features the sound from this echo generation is phenomenal not to mention that i just love alexa she is very helpful like google better just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it works as advertised very easy to setup still learning what this can do great sound and easy to set up love alexa bought others for friends love the echo i purchased it for company for my husband he is and alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs   love being able to listen to music easily still learning all the features available did t really know what i could use this device for used it for a few things but need an overview love this just wish it had a built in hub i use it primarily to play music it works wonderfully still getting used to some of the many things it will do amazon has sent several tips since i got it thanks for all your help how easy if was to set up fast response which was amazing clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic i am still getting used to alexia and have not usde echo to its full extent you re all i needna na nana does everything as expected and more i love my echo works just like they said it would i do nt have a smart home so i can not speak about that function but everything else about it is good great sound in a small packageeasy to set up and use fun to own works and sounds great the sound is amazing and many collections of all music setting up she does nt always listen its awesome i bought this because it can control fios television it works well i m hoping over time it will do more to control fios then i discovered all the other things alexa can do play music you ask for great sound from alexa play games play radio stations play old time radio programs like the long ranger alexa has many apps you can add to her abilities the other day i played madlibs great fun also alexa can control household appliances i just purchased alexa compatible power strips to control lighting fans and tv components i m looking forward to implementing this controll you can also add other alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located the speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly i like it all i love it it does everything i was a little nervous when i received my new echo as i m not really tech savvy i found it a bit intimidating at but it did nt take me to long to figure it out i m very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot i like it and still learning how to use it great technology ca nt believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful wish i had bought another one i purchased an echo dot for my husband for fathers day he uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the echo 2nd generation it was a nobrainer best gift ever works fine    clear music fun to use good sound quality the echo works well i was able to sync it with my other amazon music devices works great but i do nt think amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you have prime and buy an echo already had an echo dot the echo is even better with fuller sound also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great the speaker sounds really good good sound works well love it and alexa i am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient love it i was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered i could not pass it up its fun to ask alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from amazon prime music you can also connect your iphone with bluetooth and play music with pandora or youtube videos using alexa as a speaker i ve been having fun asking alexa different types of questions or for information like weather news or even the time in other countries the only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan because alexa uses burns it up when playing music we like it all so far but have a lot to try out yet love it   am using it strictly for music now and its great love the echo   i love the size material and speaker quality i have it hooked up to light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat next is echo dot for bedroom there is a lot more to do with echo that you think traffic weather trivia etc love it the entire family loves alexa echo she s now a part of this family great fun getting to know all the functions of this product wow   family fun and homework help talking with other grandchildrenwho also have an echo is a huge bonus ca nt wait to learn more and more and more love it awesome thing love alexa it worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound it is perfect for my classroom love love this new little gadget has made our lives so much easier its like having our own personal secretary living here in the home we hardly need our cds anymore since alexa plays everything we need going to get the alexa dots soon for more rooms thanks the speaker is of surprising quality happy with the purchase very easy to set up works wonderful and i love it i m really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device the bass sounds almost like its coming from a bigger speaker so props to amazon its still a great productbut the sound quality does seem worsedont get me wrong you definitely get used to it within but it definitely feels like echo gen sound quality was betterbesides that   its greatwith the addition of being able to play just over bluetooth with no wifi its even better the outlet does not work with it was disappointed in that great device responsive and helpful sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose i liked the sound   what is troubling is that i paid extra money to have access to more songs sometimes it does nt work ex alexa play songs do nt have or don t understand or play the opera tosca response sorry i do nt have that easy to set up and use too bad it has to be plugged in would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged still learning all the ways to use it it is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it and yrs very cute out of stars i generally like this product its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music setting timers and making calls reason why i did nt rate it out of is that sometimes the connection dies and my echo stops playing music and shows a red ring seems to be a connection issue overall great product works great upgraded from echo dot to full size echo could nt be happier its alexa what else can you say upgraded from my lilttle echo dot happy with sound excellent product set up with ease as well i ve had the first gen echo since it came out and it has worked well for me i purchased the gen during prime day and so far i m happy it seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such i love my echo smart speaker i love the volume and clarity it was easy to set up its a wonderful gift for any age wonderful product and fast delivery initially harder to set up called tech was nt that knowledgeable now working great it was very easy to set up and my family love its has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands how did i live this long without the echo   you get to enjoy any music style just my asking alexa   going to upgreade to the wireless   love the echo   love you too alexa   very cool product speaker sounds good with my spotify blasting through it having so much fun with alexa love being able to listen to music when i m across the room or busy doing something else so far it seems to be a very nice item it picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems the other day i asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine i ve only used it to listen to music and check the weather but it has done both of those things very well love our echo i love itshe is very helpful i use her for remembering things and sleep you can ask her just about anything i have only had her for so still learning her its better than the 1st gen in every way except for one i really miss the ring at the top for volume control it was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the   one and press it a few times i also wish the bass was a bit better all in all its a great device and i m happy with it i love having an alexa so far i like it   i am thoroughly enjoying my ecoo love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then i can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more still love it love it i love the sound quality of this unit it is a very clear sound i just this for listening to talk radio in and turning lights on and off etc the system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming sirius i have had for so i am still learning all that alexa can do it is a learning process i love the music i can call up any time i listen to podcasts and radio stations i have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists which i love i do nt have to search for paper and pencil getting time and temperature are great do not have to wait for weather reports the sound is good i am not fussy about woofers tweeters base   etc the echo is fine for me i am going to try dropping inon my son when he gets home going to surprise him not much features great sound quality great features great product multi room music is very cool cool everyone should have an echo or or three or more i bought my echo through qvc its annoying that everything they show alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded you spend so much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself i have had alexa since the beginning i accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the generation i decided i could nt be without an echo setup was easy and had it working within i like being able to tell alexia the music i want to hear but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if i am not very specific about the title i like the looks better than the original echo i moved my old echo to the basement family room nice sound the echo is wonderful but i m still learning how to use it music requests are somewhat limited does nt know half the things asked ca nt recognize my sprinkler even though product details says it is compatible ca nt program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same router just a handy music player that s if you have amazon music love it awesomeunderstands my kids we were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features how nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command looking forward to exploring other options with this device met and exceeded my expectations easy set up and is really quick in responses i like the fact that i can get any kind of music from prime that i want on request from alexa i liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your tv etc to the commands from alexa but i really love having the music i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account i think it should be part of the top line with video music etc i also think the setup app where i define for example music i like is not well integrated into echo i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings i also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names which i can never like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries this is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better thank you during prime day this 2nd gen echo was on sale so i could nt resist this was the beginning to my smart home set up and i could nt be happier to say that alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my smart devices thanks to her i can control my lights smart plugs tv etc i had no trouble connecting the echo to my wifi and my phone the app works perfectly fine and it lets you add skills routines smart devices timers and so much more sound quality is good enough for me since i am not an audiophile alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume design is great and modern it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you d like as there are more for sale overall this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities if you have nt yet be sure to add alexa to your home versatile and fun   works great killer speaker my wife and son love it we regret waiting so long to purchase this item we are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality stopped working after did nt follow commands really fun when it was working so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app it performs pretty much as expected but i am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology i need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the amazon music service i understand my music choices may be limited but without knowing how to ask i can not access the music that is provided free along with my echo purchase do you have a chart showing the language i need to use easy to set up i like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality i expected a great investment alexa has helped me out and made me laugh yet another exho for our home and love them all i love it i can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz not easy to find on local radio sound is good and i can stop it with a voice command if i get a phone call good value super easy set up and am loving our new echo what s not to like about this speaker just ask alexa best fathers day gift dad joked to my mom that alexa will be the listening to all of his repeated stories going forward great addition to our breakfast room kitchen tunes and information instantly available slowly learning more features sound quality sad joke worthless entertainment very good quality works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability loved it till someone stoled it ca nt afford to replace it yet but i am going too alexa rocks got this as a gift and love it i never would have bought one for myself but now that i have it allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music   that s worth it in and of itself also gives news briefs and tells jokes    my mom bought a few echo dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great i told her no for two days when she made me take it i could not live my life without it its that amazing so now we have large speakers and only the small echo dot that i will be returning to her i say if you re going to order an alexa speaker go big and get the echo otherwise toull be returning the echo dots you could nt live without love it great product easy set up very user friendly really disappointed alexa has to be plugin to wall socket all the time my fault for not checking this but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery if i could return it i would as my apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the alexa i do nt think the gen sounds as good as but it does have an aux out so you could add an external speaker but if you are going to do that why would nt you just get a dot issue is which is nt unique to this unit but i do nt understand why i ca nt override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a group i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker everything i like the interaction of asking questions i do nt like that i ca nt ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp supberb sound definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music i really love my amazon echo i think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it it is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports love it so do the grandkids so far it has worked well not always intuitive as to how to link different devices or skills but getting the hang of it works as advertised i love it love my new addition to the house speaker quality is great and over all we love our alexa my   not complaints more suggestions for the future series would be better communication ability example for our smart lights in the house unless we specify kitchen light or kitchen light 2 prior to the command she either wo nt respond or says she does nt recognize it may be me but i want my alexa to respond when i say thank you afterwards i have to repeat alexa thank you and there are times she wo nt respond to me but will my husband i know it sounds odd we laugh about it but maybe its a southern thing but i want my alexa to have manners too like everything about it the music the trivia games the weather as described and received on time do not like automatic enrolment into music a great device i owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since is her language she was born in but the sound from the echo is superb so well keep it love this have it in the kitchen and works well very nice i m impressed   wish she had more to say though love the product nice to have easy access to so much info its got great sound and bass but it does nt work all of the time its still hot or miss when it recognizes things we are still discovering all that the echo can do amazing paroduct good hearing range and sound quality it was a bit complicated to set up and she does nt quite understand me a lot even when i am speaking slowly and clearly but i love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system speaker sounds good absolutely love the best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house there is nt anything i dislike were thoroughly enjoying our amazon echo installation was easy using the alexa app i purchased kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights installation again was easy using the kasa app they sinqued right up with the echo were enjoying playing music with the echo and the sound quality is awesome we ve added a kasa smart bulb for our kitchen setup was seamless were looking forward to adding more automation to our home home entertainment very cool product easy to setup fun to use and sound quality is much better than i anticipated love these great sound easy to connect and use does nt work with my fairly new smart tv but that s mainly the tv manufacturerslg fault due to not supporting anything older than tvs from my smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well speakers sound great and works very well great sound from a little speaker we enjoy it    cool good quality great sound quality works perfectly great product sometimes alexa does not understand some commands for my fire tv all in all this is a fabulous speaker love my echo great sound very smart sure did   love it   plays great works absolutely great very amazing product great sound quality best thing i ve invested in in a while thank you so much   i am extremely impressed with this item bought it from the warehouse or outlet with a minor imperfection ca nt tell it even has works great did nt come in packaging but it was sealed up and had no damage and was nt missing anything i like the sound quality i see some knock it its not a bose but its more than great for our family easy to use minor learning curve as it learns your voice it integrates seamlessly with my other amazon servicescant wait to get for my classroom too its a lot of fun even just as a speaker let alone what i plan to do with it i love my echo show and now i have this in my bedroom and its wonderful music info sleeping sounds awesome life changer seriously i am able to start my morning with alexa by having her wakeme up with her alarm and then playing me some music she has gotten used to my voice that i can be in another room and she will listen to what i say i love both my echos do nt hesitate get one and for the price the speaker is unbelievable i am buying the cordless holder so i can take the echo anywhere love my purchase and love alexa i am not super impressed with alexa when my prime lapsed she would nt play anything she is nt smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we ca nt use it for that either she randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her just today i unplugged hernot sure ill ever use my alexa again i like everything about it   liked never had any issue with buying use electronics as long as i get the good or like new just read the comment to see why it is used our family really loves this new echo bought for my wife she loves it fun just got it today now my i pod will go in my car and i will use this is the house like it to do more this is our echo worth its like having household employees for a small flat rate we keep them in the bedrooms and the living room we can dropin and use them as an intercom listen to music answer quick questions alarms to wake up for school etc listen music and set timer i received the echo in perfect condition the device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues alexa is a great addition to our family good sound like it for music and scheduling like that i can get random thoughts recorded while i think about them the jokes are cute purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do so far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides this echo is just as great as my others even though it is smaller funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home loving it i bought this to replace a dot in my living room speaker is slightly better it hears me better over the tv unfortunately it does nt understand or respond to my requests as well as the dot i frequently have to request or times to get it to do what i want the dot usually does exactly what i want on the request i do nt consider it an upgrade i have had all good experience so far with the generation echo there are so many more things to learn but i have not had the time yet right now i am mostly enjoying the music weather updates using the alarm feature and her personality i have also purchased some mini smart socket yes i am very excited to begin using them i m having trouble connecting my tv to it but i m not exactly tech smart i m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me so far i ve been using it mostly for music simply love my echo i hardly watch any tv at all anymore i m too busy listening to music speaker is pretty goo for its size all the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family enjoyed entire echo experience easy to set up the echo is an amazing device many times it seems very intuitive but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result installation was fairly straightforward but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it was nt this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next stepmy biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done however i ca nt make any of the echos aware of the others existence when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions a small deal for many device savvy people but a challenge for me we are loving ours very much i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the generation is the best i m happy to see they are making improvements with each new oneit would be great to have updates to our little ais i think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it all in all i am very happy with her and i can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble thank you very pleased with the echo 2nd generation it is so nice to have alexa available for music weather news and probably a lot more we have nt discovered i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo if you are a big fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj you can even have conversations with the echo i am not embarrassed to say that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke it tells me where my packages are since i am an amazon prime addict it comes in extremely handy easy to setup love all the things she does have alexa throughout the housethe future has arrived i already have an alexa and with amazon find i could not resist getting an echo also it is the best thing i ever did i use them on each side of the house and could nt be happier arrived as expected bought   everything about this product is excellent   do nt forget to buy a charger when ordering its a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard terrific love my echo its smaller than the original looks nicer too works great my husband and i are what i would call late adopters when it come to technology but we decide we would try and echo to serve primarily as a music source wow were we amazed and the great sound we ve also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking alexa i may even buy one for my elderly dad   i think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us i really have enjoyed it changing the directv channels plays iheartradio and pandora   adjusts the thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights i have been wanting one of these for a while now bought on and absolutely love it we are so glad that we got the echo over a bluetooth speaker alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there i personally love the timer feature it has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously pandora integration is another feature that i use daily so happy with out prime day purchase i will get the echo hub and a few more echo dots in the future see subject line love it love it very easy setup i was hesitant to buy the echo because i have the echo dot and it seems good enough the echo is the same except the sound quality which i really did nt feel i needed however i am so glad i got it what a difference the sound really is far superior to the echo dot now i can listen to the greatest showman with a little more power sound quality is great still learning about all the different things i can do with it fun got a good deal and works great with prime setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service has worked great with nice sound from small speaker i love it works great perfect for my office love it have inside house and one by our pool now   just as good as bose speakers around house   easy to useamazing nice product a we love our echo we were totally amazed at the speaker quality only bummed we did nt buy since we got it on prime day very responsive great sound quality for its size its so efficient and amazing how cool we all use it often every day i m impressed with the quality of sound that the echo has its definitely comparable to my bose mini i only gave 4 stars because i ca nt use my apple music account technology in such a small device the price was good too the sound is amazing a must have feature for any home mainly use it for the music but i m learning more all the time really nothing bad to say about it i replaced my 1st gen was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same soundi was wrong if anything its the same volume and more clear good product great addition to my echo plus the best love the feature to play music in every room with multiple echos i love alexa i am surprised how much i use her i use this product for enjoyment and i just love it easy to use and has great soundit was a great purchase at a great price very easy to set up and have no issues this unit add much pleasure to our echo plus we now can have music and information through our home or just in room its extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it does nt answer everything i ask but its still nice to use too difficult to set up it keeps timing out before you can enter the password just getting use to using the echo used it for shopping lists listening to music and as a timer working great so far very cool and lots of fun used for and still learning its capabilities love it love it love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps i use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information its great for music a little hard to figure out how it works this was given to my at the time as a birthday gift from his dad he loves it ask alexa anything she has the answer plus its good for homework so i purchased on prime day for my bathroom for when i m getting ready for work i listen to music at and the base its booming replacement for my clock radio plus i have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock very impressed with look clarity of sound and color alexa is amazing great speaker still getting used to alexa do nt have her connected to our tv yet or other things right now use her for music and information which she is great works and sounds great my house is barely 1100sf and i have this sitting on my kitchen counter i can hear it and speak to it from any room lots of functionality still to discover i have had pure fun with my echo weather jokes news briefing and music but still so much more to use it for a lot of fun for the money use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home love it still learning makes a lot of things easier like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask alexa to turn the light off bought this for my daughter when she turned 9 she loves it i especially like the calling feature since she does nt have a cell phone she loves playing music and dancing and with amazon music she can play all her favorite songs   sometimes over and over and over again lol we got this as a wedding gift and have nt discovered all of its features yet will update playing music is great though i am impressed with the sound quality very pleased with my purchase of echo smart speaker   love the fact that i can play music of different genres whenever i wanthad some trouble at with the wi fi but it is now working my wife   i enjoy the ease of playing our music the games are fun   entertaining i look forward to adding more smart products to my home this is my echo and i love how it helps me in the kitchen i can set timers listen to the news prepare grocery lists and get great music the sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions this is my echo i have the dot but the speaker is weak so i purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great great sound great we really only use this as a speaker to stream music we ve had it and its just kinda useless once set up very user friendly setup was nt as user friendly as i d hoped the alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing invasive   drivers my wife and i are both retired and she would nt have been able to install alexa but if my son was nt supplying her with a smart phone we would nt be using alexa yet very easy set up really enjoying it the echo does nt come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it makes it quite inconvenient more compact and a bit better than the original i love it pretty cool i having it in my living room music sounds really good in my living room   i can hear it upstairs this is a great product set up was easy sound is wonderful so far i like it i bought it just for some music though and it sounds pretty good love it love it glad i bought this like all types of funmusic and more i like the volume up and down on the top so i can turn it down quickly beyond my capabilities to program grandkids lve it i love my new echo it gives me of music and help with other thingsit was difficult for me to set it up i had to have help from a tekkie almost as good as my bose love the whole house music alexa hardly came on easy setup using the app which was also easy to install on my phone the sound quality while for listening to music on pandora is wonderful i m still learning how to use the echo but so far i love it works awesome works great from such a small speaker it sounds great great sound for the size and the prize and of coursealexa if you do nt have an echo you definitely need one great device seems to work better than the generation item no longer works after of use will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests i love the echo dot so easy so fun i get to drop in on my grandaughter who lives away sounds like she is right next to me works great no different than the new ones this ones going in the kitchen for timermusic duty love it but the volume could definitely use a boost if it had better built in speakers would definitively be a star they thought ahead and put an audio auxiliary input so i bought a dedicated speaker for the echo proved to be best way to go works just fine works great looks brand new love my new echo dot i will be getting them for all the main rooms in the house for a refurbished item it works like its new which i love easy set up which i love the only issue is the volume if you are listening while relaxing its fine but if you are expecting to do anything else i recommend purchasing a speaker but not very loud this is our 2nd one and we love it so i am not sure how i feel about the echo dot its so many things that i need to get used to you have to ask her the right questions or she wo nt understand you this thing barely works you have to select party apps to do stuff you d think it could do out of the box i m sending mine back asap waste of money gift for my man he does nt like that you have to plug it in and the pictures do not show the cord would prefer it cordless still works though for the purpose we bought it this is our amazon echo device we have purchased refurbished before and been satisfied this time is no different you ca nt tell this from brand new and the price was cheaper our echos wake us up keep timers play music for us act as encyclopedias turn our lights on and off and so much more this small echo dot is amazing the sounds that come out are greatit changes my nest thermostatand my phillips hue lightswithout leaving my chair we talk to her all the time for songs and just because we can   there are nt dislikes about this device i m never disappointed with technology worked as promised i returned echo dots   am only getting refund for 1 i returned in package i want my refunds for both of them they are in the same package can you not see them both not working has weird pauses in her speech pattern that are not present in my other echo devices i sure love alexa lol thank you great price and product it works i m an echo fan but this one did not work    bought for my bathroom to listen when i m in the shower love it does nt always respond when spoken to with promp word i thought it would connect to my echo upstairs and use it like an intercom have nt been able to do that fast shipping and works well i love it love love love my new and free assistant   words alexa tell me a poop joke it worked for a month or so then it stopped i ve tried everything to try and make it work but nothing is working i want a refund poor quality gave it away refurbished is the way to go my echo works just like new love it we have of them need i say more the speakers are nt too loud alexa is great though besides that naw it works great and sounds good never could get it to work a techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter was nt strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store so i am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then almost like having star trek in your home fun to try and outsmart   this was an add on for my echo system the refurbished product works like new great for my office i use this daily in many ways to include spelling for me and background music awesome i love alexa i was nt sure i really wanted one of these but now that i have it it is extremely useful get one you ll love it initially this echo dot worked very well over time the dot stopped responding to alexa unless you were within one foot of it yelling the other echosecho dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot would not recommend buying refurbished great product fast shipping i bought an echo dot that had been refurbished but its stops whatever function its performing quite often does nt wake up every time randomly turns on but does nothing do not buy a refurbished echo dot perfect works great no problems with it being refurbished do nt trust this perfect condition i love my echo love it beautiful experience especially if hooked to smart lighting and other accessories we just got this within from what we can tell no issues my son wanted and alexa for his birthday so she could tell him jokes he could ask her questions and to listen to music she does all of that and more we all enjoy this one so much that i just bought a one during prime deals day divertido great product and works great bought this for the guest room its a radio alarm clock information center and so much more great buy bought this to go with my echo and love it the speaker is nt the best for music but works great in a kitchen for timers or alarms    works perfect save and buy the refurbished looks brand new looks and works perfect glad i got a good deal just as good as the new one i bought but 1000 less i love it works very well everything perfect good price prompt shipping has been working flawlessly i love you alexa there s room for improvement on this for the price i can not complain too much i can still complain however the audio is terrible this is kind of like listening to a speaknspell from the 80s iove it i bought it for my son because he wanted it and its awesome its an echo and it works for the price its great deal have had no issues with it as with all dots the speaker is a bit tinny but good for a unit or if you are like me you can attach it to an external speaker for more soundgood buy thanks i wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live the speech recognition software is horrible my wife and i both are native whose language is english she is from the north i am from neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us we bought two they do the same thing additionally reception was poor to marginal i had to buy wifi range extender for office and the other is from our router both had problems switched them around no difference so it they are now disconnected dust collectors this is my dot they all work perfectly and i use each one multiple times a day absolutely love them item has never worked out of box it is broken spent trying to get it working and running same fixes from amazon the only thing accomplished is i will never order another refurbished device i already have the echo plus bought this one for my bedroom love the functions simple set up music everywhere worked just like a brand new dot so i am very satisfied great product but returning for new alexa dot refurbished is already giving me problems with connection we have a few echos already went for this one in refurbished to save it works great i love this new generation one because it has a rubber bottom   nice i love the fact that i can unplug it and take it to my basement when i want do laundry refurbished but just as good as the new ones that i ve bought good as new granddaughter loves it the price is great was having trouble with it hearing me from across a room but after moving it to another spot it seems to be working fine will buy some more want in every room we have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors ca nt wait to try more new stuff using alexa thanks works great never buy certified and refurbished echo dot   i bought a certified and refurbished   echo dot this unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command never buy a refurbished echo dot the unit i received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated i also bought a new echo dot it works perfectlyvery disappointed   started here with amazon productsand i regret nothing is been absolutely great journey and my products continue to improve my daytoday life have now used for without problem this is my smart device and i will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one love love it just as good as a new one have had an larger echo for some time and love it bought this one for another portion of the house since we have several home devices and we wanted to voice control them from all over the house love the product use to turn on my lights and answer some quick questions a great buy was leary about refurbished but work great very puny sound but works great great exactly like new can tell the difference from my new dot i got prior to this one works perfectly love alexa works perfect no wear and tear on the device i love alexa working on making my home smart   works good the only thing i do nt like is it shuts off by itself other than that it works great excellent product mint condition for a refurbished unit   you would never know its been refurbished already owning a couple of echos i was frustrated that i could nt also use them as intercoms finally amazon enables the dropin feature so now i can use my echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinneras for its other features we mainly use our echos for the standard stuff playing music setting alarms answering questions etc its not the lifechanging home device amazon would have you believe but it is convenient to have around this refurb saved me a few bucks looks and works the same as the other brandnew ones love it was worried about the refurbished part at but this being my echo it is awesome have used it for everything my lights since i work and shopping as well as for my spotify and planning on getting it for my parents to help them out for everyday things we take for granted when we are young i would recommend this to everyone love alexa hope have her in every room soon the simplicity of use and setting up this is great got one for my gazebo and upstairs works great never had any issues does everything i have asked it works great good sound i use this echo to listen to music as well as a sortof research tool it can answer a variety of questions i would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder but i ca nt complaini also believe it should have an internal power source in order to use the echo it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord it would be nice to use the echo dot on the go without having to buy the other product love it great fun love it outstanding i use all the timeworks just like they say saving is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected works perfectly alexa turns on and off my lights my tv roomba never would know it was refurbished so far so good looks and performs as new no complaints goes great with our echo works great just like the new one that i already had this item did not work certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised instead this item crashed as soon as i turned it on and plugged it in when trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot it crashed over and over not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light alexa would tell me its ready to connect and freeze mid sentence tried holding the action button for and it did nt do anything returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it very fast service got what i ordered thank you love it even though i m still trying to figure out all the other things i can do with this item it works great with my phone none i have echos one i bought brand new and the other is a refurbished onehonestly i ca nt tell the difference in performance and looks a great productonce we learned how to work itthis thing is awesome it works does not work all the time love it though wish it was portable of course you could not tell this was refurbished works excellent i would highly recommended instead of purchasing new i got this for my mom   she loves it   i love my echo dot looks brand new and works perfect very satisfied same as new a small problem out of the box but a rep from amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues i was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made including follow up email to get this thing working i have now and google clone and the more i use it and learn about it the more i like it them i also plan to install one in my car boat and garage alexa is my new best friend loli think gf is worried that if alexa learns to cook her time will be limited i love my alexa dot i play games with my son ask how the weather is and i love that she works with my amazon fire tv i like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart tv if i ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if i ask you to change the channel it does or does nt sometimes i have to reset it i do nt know if its because its refurbished but its okay its just not what i expected so far the certified refurbished echo dot works well it was a little confusing to have a green ring on the echo dot and not 100 know why it was there asked alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in but that was not the case took to figure out it was a notification that i had a delivery from amazon i believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification but on my refurbished echo dot it was green and pulsed it arrived quickly and was easy to set up   it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what i expected   alexa and i have become buddies she is a great assistant works as advertised speak clearly and research the commands also get the wall holder it keeps it out of the way set up is a breeze just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone for some reason it made set up easierthough it could be psychological haha love my echo dots but the one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker the return process still is nt done and has already taken i ve already returned it the refurbished echo for has been wonderful i purchased this for my mother she loves the ability to contact me without a phone listen to music weather and ask questions its been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems works good however the price went down after i purchased it works amazingly i bought it for my daughter and she loves it i love alexa its great helping me making my appointments playing the songs i like what else can you do looking forward for more got this for the bathroom love it we can listen music whe we showering i have 3dots and 2original and this new works perfectly will buy all my future dots reconditioned was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all now i m weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them   heard about this happening on the news i have so this is very concerning i wish amazon would release something widespread or push some firmware to prevent this if they have i have not heard about it yet there s really no dislike for alexa dot i thought cortna was cool but alexa is an awesome application to the family unbelievable device which seems alive a must get i am happy with the refurbished echo dot i ve had it for and so far it is working perfectly even though it did not come in its original box it looks like new i m happy with this purchase thumbs up workreat there was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep i spoke with could fix the replacement was registered to someone else when the price of the dot went down to same price as the refurbished ones i bought a brand spanking new no problem with the new works as expected no problems have these in almost every room i really have enjoyed them works perfectly purchased for grandson like new happy with this as i was with the other i ordered love the dots especially with the ability to talk from one to the other these are really convenient no issues with the refurbished as they are like new started taking on her own have nt used it since i unplugged it that day no one was talking my daughter was laying in bed next to be and she just started going on about the movie and completely scared the sht out of my daughter now it works great the speaker sounds fine and overall would recommend great just like new loved the price for an essentially brand new dot opening it you really could nt tell that it was refurbished everything looked brand new for than a new unit i could nt consider this a better deal i really love the versatility of the echo dot get you one while you can pleased with the order just what i wanted i think i now have of these throughout the house so convenient to set a timer or check the weather or whatever wherever love it   the best my experience with refurbished devices is excellent love the echo dot this refurbished item was finebut i was nt aware that there is a fee for having other echos set up in the rooms however it was missing the cordthank you after setting it up it no longer works no connection no light no sound i guess i should nt have purchased a refurbished dot it worked like a brandnew unit great addition to my collection great price works perfectly saved the money on a refurb would buy again    verygod not good at all these are great i bought one and then bought another right away grab a few of these and a few smart switched and you re set with smart home capabilities for under highly recommended just like new worked as it should still need to figure out how to link to other devices though only set up sonos which was pretty easy not the products fault just have not had time to figure it out very useful this is the worst amazon purchase i have made i am big amazon fanlove the brandunlimited digital musicprime videoseven buy my online games music and movies through amazon this app i have tried to use it make simple purchases   to do anything it is useless works very well but the microphone do nt pick up as well as the full size echo audio quality is okay for the size i bought refurbished ones for work and home they both work perfectly and appear brand new amazon does nt disappoint works great as a bt receiver with output connected to vintage stereo equipment working great this far ca nt tell its not new will edit for longevity in that s the real test amazing i love everything this used dot works fine it compliments my echo works like a new one can tell the difference from the new one i bough and the refurbished one well i m a big fan of echoes these ones went i m my bathrooms works just great as expected   purchased for my mothershe loves talking to alexa very responsivecan detect its name from all over the room this is just like new   same performance as our brand new no problems the echo dot disconnects from the speaker times a day do not buy the refurbished product 2 stars for effort love it great product it works good very satisfied i love alexa but the sound on the dot is not the best i own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchenliving room and got this for my bedroom but there s a significant difference in sound the dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if its coming off a cheap portable speaker i was really disappointed i returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a echo for my bedroom also took me awhile to get it connected i m not electronically savy but now that it is i love it ca nt seem to get this thing to sink with my wireless not sure if i will be returning it will try more time absolutely love it product stopped working after return time ran out dot work great for refurbishedthought it was new love these guys they work so great i love this as a alexa in our bedroom great for checking weather for meditation music and as a timer   perfect for my husband who has to use eye drops multiple times each day and keep his eyes closed for i purchased this refurbished works just like brand new set up very easy now i have echo dot that i can command to start playing music for my backyard deck sound system not substitute for the original the echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor to listen it has to be at the highest level love the echo dot helps husband get netflix and other apps on our amazon fire tv no problems with it being refurbished planning on getting another one for the amazon fire stick in bedroom stopped working after the warranty was only good for i would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for i mean what is this product supposed to be a piece of junkthey offered my a discount if i wanted to buy another one why would i want to buy another just like new no problems whatsoever alexa thank you i like my uncle but sometime it goes a little haywire bought this for my son and it did nt work he had to return it bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within hard and soft reset will not fix the problem i received my echo dot today in good condition but be advised i paid for it and amazon has as of this writing raised the price to 3999 so do your research before buying so you can get a good dealset up with the dot went simple enough   plug it in follow the app instructions except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iphones wifi settings i called amazon customer service and i dunno what it is but lately i ve been getting terrible support the guy that took my call just rambled off a completely unhelpful script and i ended up setting up the dot while he was in the middle of his spielim not sure if this is the norm or if its because this is refurbished but the dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my connection is strong reconnecting is a pain each time as wellall that said when alexa works she works amazingly well i do nt have a speaker hooked up to it but one thing i really enjoy is the mics range and sensitivity one of the more annoying limitations of apples siri is that when she s playing audio through device speakers music podcasts etc the hey siri feature is all but useless alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time and with amazingly fast responsiveness too i have nt tried this with louder speakers yet so i m not sure if this will continue to hold truesetting up alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze albeit with limitations   support for arlo devices is nil and if you have special settings for your led devices eg rainbow effects alexa ca nt handle them she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levelsall in all my rating would ve been lower had i not gotten a decent price on this item if the connectivity problems persist i may have to exchangereturn this item i do nt want to though   alexas kind of growing on me i bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs but i have no need for it i only used it once the volume was not loud enough for me when i played music while i was on my treadmill so i rather use my tower speaker which is louder worked like new will do it again the one which was a refurbished model did workat least not in my home very bad this device i do nt know if its because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself   nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking when you talk you have to yell super lauded good as new just like brand new save yourself some money get one adding more rooms for convenience nice it works goodsome times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times some time almost screaming i took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for looks brand newno excuses or disappointments troublefree set up effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the alexa app on my iphone was flawless listening to my favorite tunes through a bose bluetooth setup and could nt be happier walk through the door and just ask alexa to play music and viola instant atmosphere no more opening the ipad going to settings turning on bluetooth and then accessing the pandora app it just makes things so effortless a true joy right out of the box if i did nt discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth alexas sister my dot love my alexa echo dot   i have of them now   new one refurbished both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things i love it as an alarm every morning or whenever i love it to play music or sounds of the ocean or nature sounds when i am trying to sleep just love it for so many things bought a refurb and its works just as my new ones i bought prior came in original packaging as well love it its like having a wife so far not impressed at all does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time i m not sure what the excitement is all about alexas voice sounds like its under water how am i supposed to understandim going to return and try a google home works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished works great ca nt tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode i have 3 in my home and will be adding more i love these things great product but useless overall too many unnecessary features unless you have a smart home you do nt need it worked just as good as the new echo dots i preciously purchases i bought this for my mother and she is in love with itshe loves the guard dog featureshe says that it gives her a sense of security at and when she leaves the house i bought it mainly to be a speaker when playing music or videos on my phone not working for me read instructions but not working for me it works bought of them and both work great i m not much on electronics running my home but alexa does all that i want and need to be done one more to come blue light blinks all the time fun and useful were still learning new tricks and useful functionalities this is the future of human to computer interface and household automation just like star trek who knew it would be here so soon works great to control the tv lights and various other devices lately i ve been using it when i wake up and do nt know what time it is but do nt want to open my eyes just shout out alexa what time is it if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it d be golden sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect the echo plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive echo works great was nt sure if i d like this product but after having it for a little while i want one in every room my daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words we ve barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and i m looking forward to learning all of its capabilities a great product works well absolutly love it   bought my first echo dot and loved it so i got this for work absolutely love it works as promised works great with my existing smart home setup perfect could not tell the difference from a new one i ca nt figure out how to use it good sometimes ca nt hear well i was a little apprehensive about buying a refurbished electronic product but with guarantee thought i would try it glad i did and will probably buy another refurb product form amazon i love the alexa products and have several this one sits on my desk has a small footprint but has great sound and i use it daily works great not bad bad speaker for sound this is a great device we mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list but occasionally use any number of the fun things you can program it to do like go to red alert or make the tardis land yes were a house of geeks we even chose the wakeword to be computer instead of alexa now we just need majel barrets voice and i will be in geek heaven its not as easy to get my premium spotify to work properly with it and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms but so far its still been worth it i am often asking it the time the weather it even gives us a news briefing we also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome plus its fun knowing the is listening to everything we all love her i purchased this for my daughter and we all love this its amazing we love the games it does nt always work good as new perfectly packaged and i have had issues with the dot love it bought for my granddaughter who is for her to play music and ask questions she is entertained for good buy in my honest opinion no issuesworks and looks great this is a fun toy my daughter have me it it reads to me refurbish echo dot received as new condition as new packaging no complaints neat little gadgetdrives my wife nuts i received an echo as a gift loved it so much i decided to get the dot for my bedroom both very easy to set up but a big difference in the sound quality i would still buy it again worked as advertised thanks all the new amazon products i have are great everything i bought refurbished is complete garbage i will never purchase amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction works good microphone is not as good as the better echo products took a little work to set up but i finally got it sound quality not the best but for what i got it for it works great i check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it i do play the radio on it when i want some music but will probably upgrade to the echo plus for better sound love alexa these are the best thing i have ever bought do nt know how i ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to i loved it it works great extremely low in volume i had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone i ended up using my computer it is interesting that the answers come from wikipedia however i will give echo dot an a in the music playing department i heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations also amusing when alexa responds i do nt know that why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing if i had paid full price for this gadget i would have been sorely disappointed now it seems reasonable and a step above hal brought to replace one that i moved and does nt have the same range as my previous non refurbished unit it would seldom be able to find the wifi and could nt connect got tired of hearing the message trouble connectingcheck the alexa app and just unplugged it i went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times its just not as strong if you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the echodot units simultaneously you must pay a fee i thought this was amazon not apple i ve paid for many of these so i could have one in each room is that not enough of my money purchased as a gift love it overall good device it was bought for a workout room and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine it could use a much better speaker works great and simple to set up alexa is way more accurate than i imagined so i m using it more than i thought wish alarms could be set a bit further out but that s my only complaintno she s not listening when you do nt say the wake word so if you re worried you can lose the conspiracy theories the speaker is great too so do nt hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me the voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier   the government   worked perfect had a little trouble at the beginning until i replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times alexa will be off by as much as like when it was alexa would say it was otherwise everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from amazon and my pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist i bought of these and all have worked flawlessly if they were nt labeled as refurbished i would nt have known this device works perfectly and was a good price we love alexa and are having great fun with her the music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our traffic report i did nt think i would enjoy having ai in the house but it is fun educational and entertaining even for people who are nt tech savvy eh its works on and off the time it does not respond when you say wake up name other then that works fine great little thing works better than siri its amazing i love it bought this for my son and he loves it i own the and generation echo dot i think i prefer the volume ring of the gen better than the buttons on the gen but still more than does the job and great for the price i got it for i d still definitely recommend very fun to use and having morning briefing arrived on time and works amazing just like new setup was quick   easy like new good refurbishing love it love my echo dot i like that it knows my music typethe least is that it is nt wireless and the volume is not that high great product it works great but the reason i m leaving 3 stars is because it wo nt play unless it plugged in the whole time pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available works great i love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one the problem i have with this item could just be my inexperience i ordered the wrong thing but then decided i d set it up and use alexa i was trying to replace a small bluetooth speaker in my bedroom thought i could learn as i go i downloaded the app but never could get the echo to sync with my iphone i ve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended es perfecto working good so far working great and my daughter loves it works great i love it i wanted a white dot for my white bathroom the top is black as shown which i knew but i did not realize the cord and plug were also black i wanted a white cord and plug    works great amazing great product works perfectly perfect i set up the echo dot and it worked for and then died completely do not buy refurbished i sent back for return after i received this echo dot is horrible the volume on my phone is louder than than this device my boss has one at this is not the case overall it works very well some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money have had no issues with this refurbished unit it performed expected i would buy another one if needed great for mom its inside an owlhead in her jacuzzi works great   i put this in my sons room and use the drop in option to get his attention when he is gaming or watching tv it was perfect it looked brand nrw i have nothing tocomplain about i will defently be ordering more its ok the speaker is pretty terrible google home is a better product i love it i love this answers all my stupid questions and tells me the weather for when i do nt get off the couch the quit working shortly after i got it the next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app i am not sure if it just this dot or they are all this way bought this to go in my nieces room you ca nt tell its refurbished it looks good and works like new device was not working followed all instructions for alexa echo dot and it did not come on very upsetting sent it back due to crackling noise and turning itself off and on   but what can you expect with a refurbished item best price we could find and it is so useful to have her around to answer questions it is so handy to not have to find your phone i also now have an intercom system i have never been more satisfied with a product perfect introduction to alexa works well but the speaker is not so grand getting another speaker to drop this into in the future i would have just gone with the full size echo love our echo thing the full size version sounds better though works great it has all i need for my life plans time date music seems to have trouble hearing me when i say the wake word despite being trained to my voice wonder if this has something to do with buying it refurbished our google home mini has no problems hearing us   and is much louder love it works perfectly i had a brand new echo dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good it was quite different from my expectations refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while i realized that the power adapter was faulty there is no way for me to have amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options i love amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let downupdate amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter this is why i shop on amazon i can always trust them to deliver on their products i bought this for a family member as a gift i called her to see how she likes it   she said she loves it not very loud but quality and ease of use is great sound is perfect for background music would suggest more connected together if you re trying to use for hosting a louder party looked brand new works great i love these echo dots and the refurbished ones are like new my 2nd one and i use them all the time is working like a new one for now l have another alexa devices lm a fanatic echo is good works great great price to extend the range and super value to dot offers hooked up wireless speaker to use working outsidethis dot made outdoor sound range possible without disturbing indoor light control possible amazingly fun my daughter and i just asked questions on i have now set my alarm reminder playlist shows random songs bible verses weather and morning commute it tells me which way to go dodging traffic you have to get one i do nt have it linked to my phone yet works perfect there s no difference at all between this refurb one and my new ones that i have in my house ill be buying the refurbs from here on out great product wakes me up every morning on time like new no difference from new unused original i have no complaints as far as i know these are exactly like new just a little cheaper great perfect condition like new it works just as well as the new version i got as a discount with my echo speaker i decided to purchase this version because amazon states it has the same warranty i received the echo as a gift i needed another bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible and found this smart speaker ca nt wait to see what else it can do without having a cellphone i can not use many of her features i have an ipad but do not see that of any use it is a great alarm if u r almost deaf you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room so that is reason enough to keep herit is fun to ask random questions to hear her response she does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet i think this is the one i ve purchased i m working on getting one in every room of my house i really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all echos and controlling the lights throughout my house looks great love it i ve listened to songs i have nt heard since childhood i get the news weather information its great i sent it to my dad and he talks to it constantly i love it learning knew things with it eveyday still figuring out how everything works but so far its been easy to use and understand she does make me laugh at times i purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she didshe enjoys all the little and big things it can doalexa play this song what time is it and where and how to cook this and that love love love just what i expected i love it wife hates it really happy with this purchase great speaker and easy to set up we have only been using alexa for and are having a lot of fun with our new toy it like having a new household member we are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it we love the size of the generation echo still needs a little improvement on sound i liked the original echo this is the same but shorter and with greater fabriccolor choices i miss the volume ring on top now its just the plusminus buttons not a big deal but the ring w as comforting   other than that well i do like the use of a standard usb charger port instead of the previous round pin other than that i guess it sounds the same seems to work the same still answers to alexaechocomputer so what s not to like   love the echo and how good the music sounds playing off it alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on spotify she is good with amazon music but is lacking in other major programs we love alexa we use her to play music play radio through itunes play podcasts through anypod and set reminders we listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning we rely on our custom lists we like being able to voice control the volume were sure well continue to find new usessometimes its a bit frustrating when alexa does nt understand what were saying have only had it set up for still adding smart home devices to it the speaker is great for playing music i like the size we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and its not intrusive to look at i love it it plays my sleep sounds immediately when i ask i got a unit for the bedroom i was expecting the sounds to be improved but i did nt really see a difference at all overall not a big improvement over generation amazing product i love my echo its easy to operate loads of funit is everything as advertised i use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test alexas knowledge sounds great love them fun item to play with and get used to using sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask but i think it will be better just like the other one still learning all the capabilitiesbut so far pretty pretty pretty good i like it she works well needs a learning command for unique owners and users like alexa learn tashas birthday or alexa learn my definition of fine etc other than that she is great the speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy i bought and the reason i only rate it a is i have followed the instructions for synching music to both units i know i ve done it correctly but they wo nt sync that was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units this device is awesome i bought this to compare the speaker quality to our generation speaker and i like the sound better i will ship this to my daughter though because i like the fact that my generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now love my echo still learning all the things it will do was nt able to follow instructions included in the package but found a great one on utube speaker is better than generation echo this thing is way cool you should get one if you want to be cool that is this is my first digital assistant so i m giving this a good review speaker is really good for the cheap price on prime day fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock that s what i was going to get in the place but i ended up with echo if you have nt had a go with one then definitely try itwhat i like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with my purchase came with a smart plug for 10 which i connect my lamp to alexa turn of the lights my husband likes being able to use it to listen to music i wish we knew all its capabilities my android would not allow alexa to connect fortunately my sister was here with her apple cell after an hour tech support fixed the glitches we are up and running so far so good tried to play certain broadway shows like and it gives ne the group great very satisfied with the echo alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to jimmy buffet by just asking alexa its like siri in fact siri answers more accurately then alexa i do nt see a real need for it in my household though it was a good bargain on prime day deals love my echo still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun i love you so much no different than apple to play a specific list of music you must have an amazon of spotify plusprimeetc account so you must pay to play your music 3 stars for that reason everything else is    excelente lo unico es que no esta en espanol i m still learning how to use it but so far my echo is great the sound is actually much better than i was expecting works as you d expect and then some also good sound quality considering price on sale and features the sound from this echo generation is phenomenal not to mention that i just love alexa she is very helpful like google better just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it works as advertised very easy to setup still learning what this can do great sound and easy to set up love alexa bought others for friends love the echo i purchased it for company for my husband he is and alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs   love being able to listen to music easily still learning all the features available did t really know what i could use this device for used it for a few things but need an overview love this just wish it had a built in hub i use it primarily to play music it works wonderfully still getting used to some of the many things it will do amazon has sent several tips since i got it thanks for all your help how easy if was to set up fast response which was amazing clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic i am still getting used to alexia and have not usde echo to its full extent you re all i needna na nana does everything as expected and more i love my echo works just like they said it would i do nt have a smart home so i can not speak about that function but everything else about it is good great sound in a small packageeasy to set up and use fun to own works and sounds great the sound is amazing and many collections of all music setting up she does nt always listen its awesome i bought this because it can control fios television it works well i m hoping over time it will do more to control fios then i discovered all the other things alexa can do play music you ask for great sound from alexa play games play radio stations play old time radio programs like the long ranger alexa has many apps you can add to her abilities the other day i played madlibs great fun also alexa can control household appliances i just purchased alexa compatible power strips to control lighting fans and tv components i m looking forward to implementing this controll you can also add other alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located the speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly i like it all i love it it does everything i was a little nervous when i received my new echo as i m not really tech savvy i found it a bit intimidating at but it did nt take me to long to figure it out i m very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot i like it and still learning how to use it great technology ca nt believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful wish i had bought another one i purchased an echo dot for my husband for fathers day he uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the echo 2nd generation it was a nobrainer best gift ever works fine    clear music fun to use good sound quality the echo works well i was able to sync it with my other amazon music devices works great but i do nt think amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you have prime and buy an echo already had an echo dot the echo is even better with fuller sound also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great the speaker sounds really good good sound works well love it and alexa i am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient love it i was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered i could not pass it up its fun to ask alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from amazon prime music you can also connect your iphone with bluetooth and play music with pandora or youtube videos using alexa as a speaker i ve been having fun asking alexa different types of questions or for information like weather news or even the time in other countries the only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan because alexa uses burns it up when playing music we like it all so far but have a lot to try out yet love it   am using it strictly for music now and its great love the echo   i love the size material and speaker quality i have it hooked up to light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat next is echo dot for bedroom there is a lot more to do with echo that you think traffic weather trivia etc love it the entire family loves alexa echo she s now a part of this family great fun getting to know all the functions of this product wow   family fun and homework help talking with other grandchildrenwho also have an echo is a huge bonus ca nt wait to learn more and more and more love it awesome thing love alexa it worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound it is perfect for my classroom love love this new little gadget has made our lives so much easier its like having our own personal secretary living here in the home we hardly need our cds anymore since alexa plays everything we need going to get the alexa dots soon for more rooms thanks the speaker is of surprising quality happy with the purchase very easy to set up works wonderful and i love it i m really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device the bass sounds almost like its coming from a bigger speaker so props to amazon its still a great productbut the sound quality does seem worsedont get me wrong you definitely get used to it within but it definitely feels like echo gen sound quality was betterbesides that   its greatwith the addition of being able to play just over bluetooth with no wifi its even better the outlet does not work with it was disappointed in that great device responsive and helpful sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose i liked the sound   what is troubling is that i paid extra money to have access to more songs sometimes it does nt work ex alexa play songs do nt have or don t understand or play the opera tosca response sorry i do nt have that easy to set up and use too bad it has to be plugged in would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged still learning all the ways to use it it is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it and yrs very cute out of stars i generally like this product its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music setting timers and making calls reason why i did nt rate it out of is that sometimes the connection dies and my echo stops playing music and shows a red ring seems to be a connection issue overall great product works great upgraded from echo dot to full size echo could nt be happier its alexa what else can you say upgraded from my lilttle echo dot happy with sound excellent product set up with ease as well i ve had the first gen echo since it came out and it has worked well for me i purchased the gen during prime day and so far i m happy it seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such i love my echo smart speaker i love the volume and clarity it was easy to set up its a wonderful gift for any age wonderful product and fast delivery initially harder to set up called tech was nt that knowledgeable now working great it was very easy to set up and my family love its has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands how did i live this long without the echo   you get to enjoy any music style just my asking alexa   going to upgreade to the wireless   love the echo   love you too alexa   very cool product speaker sounds good with my spotify blasting through it having so much fun with alexa love being able to listen to music when i m across the room or busy doing something else so far it seems to be a very nice item it picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems the other day i asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine i ve only used it to listen to music and check the weather but it has done both of those things very well love our echo i love itshe is very helpful i use her for remembering things and sleep you can ask her just about anything i have only had her for so still learning her its better than the 1st gen in every way except for one i really miss the ring at the top for volume control it was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the   one and press it a few times i also wish the bass was a bit better all in all its a great device and i m happy with it i love having an alexa so far i like it   i am thoroughly enjoying my ecoo love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then i can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more still love it love it i love the sound quality of this unit it is a very clear sound i just this for listening to talk radio in and turning lights on and off etc the system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming sirius i have had for so i am still learning all that alexa can do it is a learning process i love the music i can call up any time i listen to podcasts and radio stations i have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists which i love i do nt have to search for paper and pencil getting time and temperature are great do not have to wait for weather reports the sound is good i am not fussy about woofers tweeters base   etc the echo is fine for me i am going to try dropping inon my son when he gets home going to surprise him not much features great sound quality great features great product multi room music is very cool cool everyone should have an echo or or three or more i bought my echo through qvc its annoying that everything they show alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded you spend so much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself i have had alexa since the beginning i accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the generation i decided i could nt be without an echo setup was easy and had it working within i like being able to tell alexia the music i want to hear but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if i am not very specific about the title i like the looks better than the original echo i moved my old echo to the basement family room nice sound the echo is wonderful but i m still learning how to use it music requests are somewhat limited does nt know half the things asked ca nt recognize my sprinkler even though product details says it is compatible ca nt program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same router just a handy music player that s if you have amazon music love it awesomeunderstands my kids we were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features how nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command looking forward to exploring other options with this device met and exceeded my expectations easy set up and is really quick in responses i like the fact that i can get any kind of music from prime that i want on request from alexa i liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your tv etc to the commands from alexa but i really love having the music i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account i think it should be part of the top line with video music etc i also think the setup app where i define for example music i like is not well integrated into echo i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings i also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names which i can never like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries this is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better thank you during prime day this 2nd gen echo was on sale so i could nt resist this was the beginning to my smart home set up and i could nt be happier to say that alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my smart devices thanks to her i can control my lights smart plugs tv etc i had no trouble connecting the echo to my wifi and my phone the app works perfectly fine and it lets you add skills routines smart devices timers and so much more sound quality is good enough for me since i am not an audiophile alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume design is great and modern it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you d like as there are more for sale overall this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities if you have nt yet be sure to add alexa to your home versatile and fun   works great killer speaker my wife and son love it we regret waiting so long to purchase this item we are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality stopped working after did nt follow commands really fun when it was working so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app it performs pretty much as expected but i am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology i need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the amazon music service i understand my music choices may be limited but without knowing how to ask i can not access the music that is provided free along with my echo purchase do you have a chart showing the language i need to use easy to set up i like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality i expected a great investment alexa has helped me out and made me laugh yet another exho for our home and love them all i love it i can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz not easy to find on local radio sound is good and i can stop it with a voice command if i get a phone call good value super easy set up and am loving our new echo what s not to like about this speaker just ask alexa best fathers day gift dad joked to my mom that alexa will be the listening to all of his repeated stories going forward great addition to our breakfast room kitchen tunes and information instantly available slowly learning more features sound quality sad joke worthless entertainment very good quality works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability loved it till someone stoled it ca nt afford to replace it yet but i am going too alexa rocks got this as a gift and love it i never would have bought one for myself but now that i have it allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music   that s worth it in and of itself also gives news briefs and tells jokes    my mom bought a few echo dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great i told her no for two days when she made me take it i could not live my life without it its that amazing so now we have large speakers and only the small echo dot that i will be returning to her i say if you re going to order an alexa speaker go big and get the echo otherwise toull be returning the echo dots you could nt live without love it great product easy set up very user friendly really disappointed alexa has to be plugin to wall socket all the time my fault for not checking this but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery if i could return it i would as my apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the alexa i do nt think the gen sounds as good as but it does have an aux out so you could add an external speaker but if you are going to do that why would nt you just get a dot issue is which is nt unique to this unit but i do nt understand why i ca nt override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a group i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker everything i like the interaction of asking questions i do nt like that i ca nt ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp supberb sound definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music i really love my amazon echo i think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it it is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports love it so do the grandkids so far it has worked well not always intuitive as to how to link different devices or skills but getting the hang of it works as advertised i love it love my new addition to the house speaker quality is great and over all we love our alexa my   not complaints more suggestions for the future series would be better communication ability example for our smart lights in the house unless we specify kitchen light or kitchen light 2 prior to the command she either wo nt respond or says she does nt recognize it may be me but i want my alexa to respond when i say thank you afterwards i have to repeat alexa thank you and there are times she wo nt respond to me but will my husband i know it sounds odd we laugh about it but maybe its a southern thing but i want my alexa to have manners too like everything about it the music the trivia games the weather as described and received on time do not like automatic enrolment into music a great device i owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since is her language she was born in but the sound from the echo is superb so well keep it love this have it in the kitchen and works well very nice i m impressed   wish she had more to say though love the product nice to have easy access to so much info its got great sound and bass but it does nt work all of the time its still hot or miss when it recognizes things we are still discovering all that the echo can do amazing paroduct good hearing range and sound quality it was a bit complicated to set up and she does nt quite understand me a lot even when i am speaking slowly and clearly but i love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system speaker sounds good absolutely love the best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house there is nt anything i dislike were thoroughly enjoying our amazon echo installation was easy using the alexa app i purchased kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights installation again was easy using the kasa app they sinqued right up with the echo were enjoying playing music with the echo and the sound quality is awesome we ve added a kasa smart bulb for our kitchen setup was seamless were looking forward to adding more automation to our home home entertainment very cool product easy to setup fun to use and sound quality is much better than i anticipated love these great sound easy to connect and use does nt work with my fairly new smart tv but that s mainly the tv manufacturerslg fault due to not supporting anything older than tvs from my smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well speakers sound great and works very well great sound from a little speaker we enjoy it    cool good quality great sound quality works perfectly great product sometimes alexa does not understand some commands for my fire tv all in all this is a fabulous speaker love my echo great sound very smart sure did   love it   plays great works absolutely great very amazing product great sound quality best thing i ve invested in in a while thank you so much   i am extremely impressed with this item bought it from the warehouse or outlet with a minor imperfection ca nt tell it even has works great did nt come in packaging but it was sealed up and had no damage and was nt missing anything i like the sound quality i see some knock it its not a bose but its more than great for our family easy to use minor learning curve as it learns your voice it integrates seamlessly with my other amazon servicescant wait to get for my classroom too its a lot of fun even just as a speaker let alone what i plan to do with it i love my echo show and now i have this in my bedroom and its wonderful music info sleeping sounds awesome life changer seriously i am able to start my morning with alexa by having her wakeme up with her alarm and then playing me some music she has gotten used to my voice that i can be in another room and she will listen to what i say i love both my echos do nt hesitate get one and for the price the speaker is unbelievable i am buying the cordless holder so i can take the echo anywhere love my purchase and love alexa i am not super impressed with alexa when my prime lapsed she would nt play anything she is nt smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we ca nt use it for that either she randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her just today i unplugged hernot sure ill ever use my alexa again i like everything about it   liked never had any issue with buying use electronics as long as i get the good or like new just read the comment to see why it is used our family really loves this new echo bought for my wife she loves it fun just got it today now my i pod will go in my car and i will use this is the house like it to do more this is our echo worth its like having household employees for a small flat rate we keep them in the bedrooms and the living room we can dropin and use them as an intercom listen to music answer quick questions alarms to wake up for school etc listen music and set timer i received the echo in perfect condition the device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues alexa is a great addition to our family good sound like it for music and scheduling like that i can get random thoughts recorded while i think about them the jokes are cute purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do so far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides this echo is just as great as my others even though it is smaller funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home loving it i bought this to replace a dot in my living room speaker is slightly better it hears me better over the tv unfortunately it does nt understand or respond to my requests as well as the dot i frequently have to request or times to get it to do what i want the dot usually does exactly what i want on the request i do nt consider it an upgrade i have had all good experience so far with the generation echo there are so many more things to learn but i have not had the time yet right now i am mostly enjoying the music weather updates using the alarm feature and her personality i have also purchased some mini smart socket yes i am very excited to begin using them i m having trouble connecting my tv to it but i m not exactly tech smart i m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me so far i ve been using it mostly for music simply love my echo i hardly watch any tv at all anymore i m too busy listening to music speaker is pretty goo for its size all the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family enjoyed entire echo experience easy to set up the echo is an amazing device many times it seems very intuitive but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result installation was fairly straightforward but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it was nt this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next stepmy biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done however i ca nt make any of the echos aware of the others existence when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions a small deal for many device savvy people but a challenge for me we are loving ours very much i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the generation is the best i m happy to see they are making improvements with each new oneit would be great to have updates to our little ais i think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it all in all i am very happy with her and i can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble thank you very pleased with the echo 2nd generation it is so nice to have alexa available for music weather news and probably a lot more we have nt discovered i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo if you are a big fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj you can even have conversations with the echo i am not embarrassed to say that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke it tells me where my packages are since i am an amazon prime addict it comes in extremely handy easy to setup love all the things she does have alexa throughout the housethe future has arrived i already have an alexa and with amazon find i could not resist getting an echo also it is the best thing i ever did i use them on each side of the house and could nt be happier arrived as expected bought   everything about this product is excellent   do nt forget to buy a charger when ordering its a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard terrific love my echo its smaller than the original looks nicer too works great my husband and i are what i would call late adopters when it come to technology but we decide we would try and echo to serve primarily as a music source wow were we amazed and the great sound we ve also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking alexa i may even buy one for my elderly dad   i think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us i really have enjoyed it changing the directv channels plays iheartradio and pandora   adjusts the thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights i have been wanting one of these for a while now bought on and absolutely love it we are so glad that we got the echo over a bluetooth speaker alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there i personally love the timer feature it has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously pandora integration is another feature that i use daily so happy with out prime day purchase i will get the echo hub and a few more echo dots in the future see subject line love it love it very easy setup i was hesitant to buy the echo because i have the echo dot and it seems good enough the echo is the same except the sound quality which i really did nt feel i needed however i am so glad i got it what a difference the sound really is far superior to the echo dot now i can listen to the greatest showman with a little more power sound quality is great still learning about all the different things i can do with it fun got a good deal and works great with prime setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service has worked great with nice sound from small speaker i love it works great perfect for my office love it have inside house and one by our pool now   just as good as bose speakers around house   easy to useamazing nice product a we love our echo we were totally amazed at the speaker quality only bummed we did nt buy since we got it on prime day very responsive great sound quality for its size its so efficient and amazing how cool we all use it often every day i m impressed with the quality of sound that the echo has its definitely comparable to my bose mini i only gave 4 stars because i ca nt use my apple music account technology in such a small device the price was good too the sound is amazing a must have feature for any home mainly use it for the music but i m learning more all the time really nothing bad to say about it i replaced my 1st gen was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same soundi was wrong if anything its the same volume and more clear good product great addition to my echo plus the best love the feature to play music in every room with multiple echos i love alexa i am surprised how much i use her i use this product for enjoyment and i just love it easy to use and has great soundit was a great purchase at a great price very easy to set up and have no issues this unit add much pleasure to our echo plus we now can have music and information through our home or just in room its extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it does nt answer everything i ask but its still nice to use too difficult to set up it keeps timing out before you can enter the password just getting use to using the echo used it for shopping lists listening to music and as a timer working great so far very cool and lots of fun used for and still learning its capabilities love it love it love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps i use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information its great for music a little hard to figure out how it works this was given to my at the time as a birthday gift from his dad he loves it ask alexa anything she has the answer plus its good for homework so i purchased on prime day for my bathroom for when i m getting ready for work i listen to music at and the base its booming replacement for my clock radio plus i have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock very impressed with look clarity of sound and color alexa is amazing great speaker still getting used to alexa do nt have her connected to our tv yet or other things right now use her for music and information which she is great works and sounds great my house is barely 1100sf and i have this sitting on my kitchen counter i can hear it and speak to it from any room lots of functionality still to discover i have had pure fun with my echo weather jokes news briefing and music but still so much more to use it for a lot of fun for the money use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home love it still learning makes a lot of things easier like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask alexa to turn the light off bought this for my daughter when she turned 9 she loves it i especially like the calling feature since she does nt have a cell phone she loves playing music and dancing and with amazon music she can play all her favorite songs   sometimes over and over and over again lol we got this as a wedding gift and have nt discovered all of its features yet will update playing music is great though i am impressed with the sound quality very pleased with my purchase of echo smart speaker   love the fact that i can play music of different genres whenever i wanthad some trouble at with the wi fi but it is now working my wife   i enjoy the ease of playing our music the games are fun   entertaining i look forward to adding more smart products to my home this is my echo and i love how it helps me in the kitchen i can set timers listen to the news prepare grocery lists and get great music the sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions this is my echo i have the dot but the speaker is weak so i purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great great sound great we really only use this as a speaker to stream music we ve had it and its just kinda useless once set up very user friendly setup was nt as user friendly as i d hoped the alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing invasive   drivers my wife and i are both retired and she would nt have been able to install alexa but if my son was nt supplying her with a smart phone we would nt be using alexa yet very easy set up really enjoying it the echo does nt come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it makes it quite inconvenient more compact and a bit better than the original i love it pretty cool i having it in my living room music sounds really good in my living room   i can hear it upstairs this is a great product set up was easy sound is wonderful so far i like it i bought it just for some music though and it sounds pretty good love it love it glad i bought this like all types of funmusic and more i like the volume up and down on the top so i can turn it down quickly beyond my capabilities to program grandkids lve it i love my new echo it gives me of music and help with other thingsit was difficult for me to set it up i had to have help from a tekkie almost as good as my bose love the whole house music alexa hardly came on easy setup using the app which was also easy to install on my phone the sound quality while for listening to music on pandora is wonderful i m still learning how to use the echo but so far i love it works awesome works great from such a small speaker it sounds great great sound for the size and the prize and of coursealexa if you do nt have an echo you definitely need one great device seems to work better than generation very useful great prime day buy i love alexa alexa is easy to operate and set up have had it for now and love it great speaker with a lot of capabilities very fun to learn how to use it i used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos do nt use it for much as i thought we would synced with kasacam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot lyrics for music is cool too other than that its used as a clock and standard dotish features amazing so far just got it the other day i like that its smaller but it has never understood commands as easily as our firstgen original echo did worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock however for the price it should come with the stand i love this device all the functionality of an amazon echo with the added benefit of a video screen it looks great on my nightstand as a clock lots of faces to choose from and displays weather reminders etc i think it can do video calls too but i use facetime for that anyway its a great shape and does nt take up a lot of room i m planning to get another one for my guest room awesome for a great price i love the echo spot this bedside alarm clock size device can do what theecho show can do i was concerned because i already had a large echo in mybedroom that answered to alexa like the other devices in my home i wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when i discoveredthat i had other name choices not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusioni named him echo now if i could only choose a male voice i loved that i could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell so many more features do nt forget to buy thestandbase so many advantages to having that read the reviews highly recommend i love this little spot more than i thought i would the sound is great for such a little thingmy music plays nice and loud and clear the video is terrifici was watching some prime shows just for the heck of it and i was really impressed immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthdayonly thing that kept me from giving it starsi really wish it was cordless i love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain and it wo nt connect to my bluetooth speaker while playing amazon prime music for some reason which is a drag when i want to hear it in the dining room during dinner of course if it was cordless i could just bring it with meotherwise i absolutely love it and will probably buy another one i bought on prime day and so glad i did its easy to use and lots of customization options i know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read but i disagree honestly i like it but at the same time i do nt i could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half i bought it for the video chat and i have never really used it overall its great and i like that i can see lyrics and the time and date however sometimes it freezes and does nt respond properlyno error message about lack of connectivityit just stops resetting resolves the problem i love all that you can do with the echo spot the thing i like most about my echo spot is the voice command feature you can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the echo easy to use love it perfect for an alarm clock replacement plus so much more i love the echo spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom we absolutely love this product wish we would have bought this instead of the dots we like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly you can even hear music played the speaker is clear we are enjoying it what we did not like because it was creepy was that before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me i asked the echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song the echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before it was a little disconcerting i like echo spot i bought it to use as an alarm clock one negative that i did nt really think about when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm or hard to remember commands to snooze for in this case a clock with buttons seems to work better this is our echo spot   to go with out echo dots   love the look and how alexia responds love my echo spot it is very slow compared to the echo i love the way it is designed and you have choices for the face i use it for my bed side i drop in on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling terrific sound for a small device and nice form factor for the nightstand i like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking alexa not using video much but it would be nice if the device had a squarerectangular screen new to alexa like this spot a lot its not perfect but i really like this little gizmo i bought it primarily for purposes first so i could set wakeup alarms by individual days and set the wakeup music individually by i wanted to control a bedroom light by voice so i could shut it off as i was falling asleep without having to get out of bed to turn a switch the echo spot together with a smart plughas been able to accomplish that a bonus has been getting alexa to play music from my amazon prime playlistswhats not so great is that sometimes alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating hopefully the ai gets better in the future along with added functions i love it it is so easy to use put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm works great every morning i get the weather and news when i get up also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and i have love it part of it is my fault i thought it could be wireless though for the price i still feel like it should be also the sound quality and volume could be better i prefer the tap unless you really want to have the call options but most of us have phones computers or ipads just not worth it very easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone i love my new echo spot i love this clock i just have to tell it to set my alarm no more fussing with buttons could nt be more pleased amazon hit this one out of the park looks great and runs great love it responds easily and like the ability to do at night easy setup love it simply amazing what a awsome device it never ceases to amaze me wake up to big bang music go to sleep softly falling rain drop in on the kids and keep in touch i have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do i was skeptical at but it grows on you it looks good so far i did however turn off the camera sound quality is disappointing i love it i especially love that it is so small and does so much got rid of my old cdalarm clock radio much more room on nightstand great sound and video plus all the great stuff that alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off the ease to use product so far pretty happy with the spot for me it really is a glorified alarm clockradio and i know i could have something more cost effective but eh i like it i had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did so far so good i am just entering the smart technology world i have nt figured it all out yet but so far its pretty cool it was smaller than i had anticipated and when i say that i very much mean it however it still works very well quality sound easily programmed easy to work with but alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs    love my echo spot great deal great product perfect i had a couple of echo dots previously   bought these specifically for the ring doorbell video   cloud cam display   interface capabilities was not disappointed love the fact that i can ask to see front yard   back yard   front door etcthe video chat with the other rooms is also quite coolbonus alexa show me ant man trailer etci know this can all be done on laptopdesktop but its cool now having an appliance that s always just there and it does nt interrupt what i m doing bought this for my bedroom and the show for my living room love them both the spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design shows lyrics photos   etc i paired it with a smart plug for the bedroom lamps alexa turn off lights love it love that is can do so much it sits on my nightstand only improvements i would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger but overall i m happy i have it would recommend it was a gift and the recipient love love loves it   cool little piece of techwere still learning some of its functions and possibilities but i can see some potential even my technically challenged wife already figured out how to video call our daughter i have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock it is the perfect bedside counter device   alarm wake up music weather top news stories etc perfect device for what i wanted and does so much more than i expected it to do calling feature is also a huge selling point this is a must own item probably will grab more echos in the future as an alexa device it works just as well as any of the other products unfortunately it does nt go up from there the ability to play videos is very limited you can not play youtube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange there is quite a selection of clock faces and you can control what is displays with glaring and very annoying exception you ca nt turn off the things to try screen you can turn off the screen scroll but that defeats the purpose of having the screen i do nt need to be reminded what things i can do with alexa i do nt need the advertising especially at the cost of this device overall its an expensive alexa device with a screen that s not very useful and annoying i would not recommend this until the amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that s actually useful so far so good this device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock i love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room its the nightstand clock i have had in my bedroom in because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep the screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at alloverall a great addition to my smart home its nice to be able to tell alexa to turn onoff the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone i have a bunch of other alexa devices but this was the first one with a screen i love this thing i talk to it through walls and in other rooms i have been an amazon lover for a while so i have amazon music unlimited kindle unlimited prime video etc so i was ready for this when it came out the screen is just so nice to havethe only thing resembling a down side is that it does nt always perfectly understand which song i want to hear but i do have a deep southern accent lower alabama so i do nt speak anyways smaller than i thought it would be happy i got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table echo spot works well except it does not work with the ring doorbell as it states on the website since they were sold as a pair i thought that it would be app ready unfortunately that is not case perhaps ring will update so that they can be integrated nice i like it    we ve owned a number of echo devices but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool other than playing music through a sound system we have nt found much use for them we just do nt find the voice user interface to be all that efficient the echo spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you re routinely interested in furthermore you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings we now use these as bedside clocks i love my echo spot waking to my favorite music being able to completely turn off display at so my bedroom is dark all the skills i have yet to try easy to use i like how small it is but i m still able to see my ring cameras great for checking in on my son after school when i m still at work love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so i can plan my route accordingly love it super fun easy to use my even gets involved i returnef this item because it does not speak    i am a hardcore fan of echo infact i am in love with all members of my alexa family i have echo echo dot echo plus and now this new toddler echo spot every variant has its own beauty i love feel and size of echo spot its fabulous as far as looks are concerned it does not have great audio quality which i did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size i bought it to connect with my bose soundtouch love this i love being able to have alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for alexa does nt work as well as the normal echo sometimes alexa does nt hear me when i try to interrupt her it to give new instructions the speaker also is nt as good as the normal echo screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who s at the front door but its great for the bedside fun tech toy love it small with good sound with the combination of this smart plugins and the alex app i can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling alexa to do it i can order stuff get answers watch videos get weather set alarms video call and so much more with this device great product in a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house extrimelly useful hub of information music automation communication and assistant in basic needs would love to have a voice personalization some things are better not to said aloud but typed like door unlocking codes but that is problem of unwitty developers so far only positive experience the privacy invasions is happened way before alexa it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier to alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off i love this device its so great what a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker only reason i did nt give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing youtube videos and google play music the camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and its dark in the roomother than those minor things i love it great buy and would buy again hands free control great love the display and easy to use though still learning what all it can do everyday it has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start even from a distance a lot of the skills are excellent i ve added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but its ridiculous that it ca nt access youtubeit might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event i imagine this is a functionality people would use often setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock great product highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it it sits much better on the desk eh its cool and all but also kinda boring i do nt really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so is about right i ca nt connect to my spotify unless its premium and i m in college and i m not paying or that or amazon music so i am huge amazon fan to have a kindle and the echo i waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile i do love it my kids love it they love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out i thought as long as someone would facetime me i could do it through that and i ca nt its spot to spot ca nt even skype which i do often with my aunt the is my major disappointment with it love love love these the only think i notice is that it does nt pickup my voice and commands as well as my echo and echo dots we have echo products throughout our house i have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock i m no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists love my amazon products love this love my spot have that   a dot and a regular echo nice upgrade from an echo dot works decent wish it was able to answer more questionsneed a better source for info but the rest works great i ca nt live without alexa really like it the screen is a major plus did nt think i d get an alexa device but this is perfect for my home office the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other alexa devices it can show lyrics of songs play my xm radio can show videos of movie trailers and news its great i love it i made a group with my echo dot so i get music through my home i am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully i can get another spot for my bedroom i love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice when we received this product it was great however the device served up a video advertisement at and scared myself and my family if you want to make sure you are protected and do nt allow video directly in your home the spot is not a device that can keep you safe its fun to use and makes my life easier in some sense love it      i got my echo spot on and love it i think it still is a little expensive but the chance to save convinced me to buy it i basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly i also like the sleep sounds skill and hearing the weather i m still exploring the other skillsjust discovered some star trek sounds alexa beam me up which are fun love this replaced an old alarm clock in my bedroom with this love that it dims at very responsive to commands love my spot she even more than i expected great size for a bedroom so far so good just got it and i am trying to figure out all the things it can do the product itself is very well made and easy to set up after alexa did not answer i have disconnected and will see if it does any better after reconnecting perfect may favorite alexa device by far specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cams it does the job really well we changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive good job amazon is great use it for music mostly it wo nt receive calls and its really hard to call someone who has another echo this is our step into a smart home soon as i added item to the grocery list i started loving it my wife was soso about it til i opened rain sounds she s a convert   love these and the dots like the little spot now our guest room is alexa enabled we love our echo spots we now have through the house and like that you can drop in on the other spots we do wish the clock faces had more customization options and that there were more faces in general its very smart and sweet design so far just ok love this for bedside clockalarmradio face can dimat night so its not bright for sleeping love this product i use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options the only thing i would like to see them add on to it is the ability to fall asleep to mu as if and set a timer for it to go off on its own like you can with tv t hcfe sleep mode love this so glad i purchased i wanted to see my security video cameras without having to use my phone works great and extremely easy to set up the echo spot is great we bot on prime day one for use as a clockradio in the bedroom and one in the family room to control lights and watch the front door when the doorbell rings music sound is very good not as good as the echo but way better than our dots if we could only buy amazon device it would be the spot i bought two one for my office and one for my bedside table they are fantastic the screen is just big enough when using the drop in feature to communicate with my mom i ca nt wait for prime day again to get one for my moms bedside table fantastic product absolutely love it love these i do like the product we bought it on but it was cheaper then prime day still a really cool device i wish i would have waited still learning how to ise it but is does not disappoint i m giving to everyone for christmas so i can check in on them unnannounced like they do mejust show up with no advanced warning very helpful with activities exactly as advertised its very nice more than i expected i use it for timers alarms shopping lists calendar events news weather and so much more great i really like it works well trivia games and shopping on it is funsometimes it misunderstands what i say but other then that the speaker is decent video chat is good but you do need to be in a well lit room so the other end can see you lol fun to work with still learning everything she can do awesome i love that it shows the lyrics of songs love the alarm featurejust tell what time i think the dot listens better than spot had a dot and upgraded to this i like it my only complaint is the very short instructions big step up from the dot dropped star due to consistent delay in bringing up ring pro video though looks great once the feed is displayed easy set up and to use i bought two one for my house and one for my grandfather i set it up for him a gave him a lesson and he calls me at least once a day its is great to be able to see him in between visits i wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom but the font is too small to see from any distance and apparently you ca nt change it great size for bedside plus it dims at night i love it and it works great the only issue is the drop in facetime like feature sometimes lags but that could possibly be an issue with my wifi for where we have it located in the house love to have meditation music i use it as a morning alarm just to mention few in general i love it i do nt know why i like it but i do its like an allinone alarm clock if you have other alexa devices you know what it is if you are looking to get an alarm clock this is the one to get yes its much more than that it shows you the time it shows you the weather its touch screen it shows you music lyrics and it does all the things your typical alexa device does its quite loud for its size as well sound way better than echo dot it also does video calling which is pretty awesome the viewing angle is great so even if its sitting fairly high up you can still see the display well enough quick and easy to set up i was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement   the display brightness dims too much at to accomplish this taskthe display works well for camera viewingit is an attractive device and a decent value at great device i m a fan of echo devices i think its a great alternative to a clean clock i like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep my sleeps so much better with it on we also use it to tell my stories only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at i own echo devices consider me addicted this little number is awesome not only do i like that it displays the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other echo devices feature i really like is how it slowly dims after i turn off my bedroom light so i have a night light for a bit i love echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them i enjoy this little thing a lot will do almost anything i like the jokes it tells i m still learning different functions meh best looking echo device easy to use a helpful product with a few glitches eg inability to occasionally access all flash briefing stations and understand or answer certain questions but amazon will likely fix and improve it we like it very convenient i love the size of the echo spot it fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show i like going to sleep with the lightening storm the images along with the sounds are very relaxing the calling and messaging feature is great its small enough to take with when we travel i love and own most of the alexa products our whole family uses them the amazon alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen love the spot easy to use easy to set up i love my echo spot that my daughter and son in law got me for my birthday alexa wakes me and plays music when i ask this product currently has related software flaws that make it completely unusable1 there is a card on the homescreen called things to try   its an ad for other alexa services you can try you can turn off all the other homescreen cards but not this one2 by default the homescreen cards cycle automatically which is incredibly annoying there is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only cycle once instead of cycle continuously but critically this setting does not work my unit has been set to cycle once and the cards still continue to cycle all the time have rebooted the device reset etc etcuntil these obvious software issues are fixed in my opinion the product is useless great deal on prime day no problem excelente su funcionamiento y llama la atencion la rapidez de respuesta y el control que se logra a traves de la utilizacion con alexa me sorprendio gratamente muy recomendable i love love it   purchased this on prime day and i absolutely love it i had the echo dot on my nightstand but i really missed a display this is perfect and the speakers are excellent yes it met my expectations the snooze on the alarm needs a but of work tap it and it snoozes swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss but without my glasses i ca nt read it and often it just snoozes then one day i must have dismissed tomorrows alarm because it never went off i have it set for monthu fri i do nt need to get up early a more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice my old alarm had a red light great product and i like the screen for a alarm clock such a fun easy and convenient device to have around the house no need to pick up my phone to look something up just a few words and the world is at your fingertips the speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp the price is right for a device like this a great replacement for the bedside alarm clock which had a funny habit of going off at every time the cleaning ladies came through we mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off while leaving the fan running only gripe would be the mic sensitivity which does nt appear be as good as the view or gen2 it can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself this product has made my life much simpler with a little one i use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it onoff or updown is a breeze the screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news works well and was easy to set up love my spot it now acts as my new alarm this is the one of my favorite amazon devices have one in my bedroom and use as alarm clock perfect addition to our home of alexa devices was nt so sure about bringing smart technology into my home but i m hooked i love the sleek look of the echo spot on my nightstand and how easy it was to set up and use i also love that it scrolls the news local weather and give suggestions of what to ask alexa i use this as my alarm clock speaker and have it syncd with the etekcity voltson wifi smart plugs to control the lighting in my apartment love it you need a harvard law degree to operate this thing its going back very soon love it getting use to it and alexa is getting use to my voice   sometimes she does nt answer but i think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice is nt strong over all i have nt had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about thank goodness i did nt listen to those reviews and paid attention to the apple guy   product turns on randomly and sometimes at night i used it as an alarm clock i lov it it was much smaller than i was expecting for the cost i m amazed alexa wakes me up everyday for work to whatever station on iheart radio or spotify i want plus when i do get smart home devices shell be even more useful to me she s really helpful with answering random questions the small screen sucks for video as it is small and round but its nice to have something to show time and pictures fun so farstill learning how it all works i purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because i found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking cutting cleaning etc especially when our counters are nt very wide to begin with after going back and forth between this and the show i decided on this because i felt it had all the same features but is more compact i can honestly say i have no regrets while i probably would nt watch a movie i d been dying to see on this its a great way to listen to music watch a quick youtube video etc i even attempted watching jaws on this and while it was nt the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do it was nt as bad as one would think i would definitely recommend we love the echo spot i use it on my nightstand for alarm clock and play iheartradio radio while getting dressed it was easy set up i use it more than i thought i would love this but there is no way to stop the screen from constantly scrolling through things to try if amazon would make this a setting i would change my review to 5 stars i am a small business owner with no staff with the alexa driven echo spot i feel like i ve hired my first assistant my echo spot keeps me organized updated and assistance when i need information that will help my day run more smoothly i love my echo spot so much i bought 2 more for my kids who love their echo spot too i highly recommend this productsuggested improvement for future versions make the echo spot wireless   bedroom clock   ask questions weather reportsalarm clock   music   download music speakers are not as loud as google home i have nt figured out how to make or receive calls device tells me i need to register and i do not know what to do i need to get some better controls for custom displays and the ability to make my own clock but that s asking a lot in general great device glad i got it great buy gave it my daughter for her birthday she loves it sound is amazing she plays music on it constantly worth this is the amazon device purchased we have 2 echo shows and now the spot i use the product as an alarm clock i love being able to set my schedule for and not worry about it when images are shown they are cut off little because its trying to fit it into a circle love the ease of use and convenience the echo spot has offered great product and i would give stars   but you ca nt scroll face cards without having the stupid try and ask alexa suggestions pop up yes you can have it scroll once and just stay on the clock but i like having other cards as well god its the worst and so irritating i got it super cheap so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a dot instead of a spot what a dumb move on part love that i have command access to news such as that you gain access to alexa app before setting up device and get familiar with key featuresservicessuch as setting up your commuteif family and friends have spotthen its a great substitute for skype and face timeyou can always drop in when missing loved ones or just to catch up good size screen and gets good range for voice commands sometimes it picks up weird commands when i m watching tv though great product for the price if you do nt need the big show screen it is a good addition to my small space and it keeps me up to date on events and weather conditions best thing i have ever owned started with the dot and now added the spot and i love iy i love it the coolest thing since sliced bread this product is a complete waste of money when you ask alexa a question she either does nt know the answer gives you the wrong answer or finds information off of honestly its no different from the echo dots i already own other then occasionally seeing the lyrics to a song i m listening too i really do nt see the difference i got this for my husband on prime day he loves it as his alarm clock and smart device this is our echo device and we have them all connected throughout the house although you can deactivate the camera we also chose to cover it since the device is in our bedroom i m not comfortable with having a camera in the room no we do nt bring our cell phones in the room great product what they do nt tell you is that once you allow a drop in they can drop in anytime while they are sleeping while we are yelling at them while anything i have two one in my computer room and the other that i move around out on the deck not great for watching video but it can be done with the added sound you do nt get from the echo dot it is perfect for the location i have it in add whole house music and you have just arrived in surprisingly handy wish it had more options geared towards it being on your nigh stand like an even dimmer setting i was on beta list for alexa have a show an original alexa echos and i actually like this the best even more than show love it i was contacted by people in were they suppose to charge me 7900 it was very hard to understand their instructions they did have control of my computer and network i also bought a cloud cam but do not know how to make it work with alexa i have the dot and echo plus this one ca nt seem to hear me as well and does nt do as much as i expected bought this for our son as his birthday present and he loves it often find him jamming to music in his room now   he loves the options for the alarms and we have his alarms set to repeat and he gets to sleep in on nonschool days great product i love my echo spot excellent purchase what a great little gadget for the house you ask and it delivers period well done i switched to google the amazon helper is more for shopping and google is the tasks assistant my favorite echo a more than adequate replacement for a clock radio the echo spot is compact nice sound and camera quality makes it great to video chat with the family when i m travelling for work ease of use that the youngest member has no problem talking to mama on the video chat and understands the important of digital security this echo spot is great i love it the voice recognition is amazing perfect companion for the bedroom i liked it perfect size the screen is really clear and elegant i am not easily impressed with electronic goodies butomg this is by far the coolest thing i have ever had it does everything short of clean your house which when i asked alexa to clean my house was told she did nt have hands but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning from reading books to my to video chat to silly selfies music that automatically goes to my bose bluetooth speaker setting timers alarms changing my thermostat on voice command tells me the weather sends hubby a grocery pick up list and i am sure million more thingsbuy ityou u will not regret it this product is beautifully designed and i no longer have to hide an echo device away like i did with dot it would be nice if amazon would lose that camera though which i have not used and might cause squirms for the privacy conscious    love this little dot with a screen super easy to set up and easy to use instantly connected to all my other echo products i also bought the screen cover that has the blocking button for the camera if you want to use it recommended alexa is not as smart as siri can not cancel snooze after alarm goes off have to cancel preset alarm for great product except there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time permanently when in clock mode the screen rotates between the clock face and a things to try screen i intended on buying several units for my house but i do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me acting as clock should be a basic feature of the echo spot how could you get this wrong amazon fail i wanted to use this as a bedside clock with the ability to play music and podcasts sadly it continuously scrolls the things to try and wo nt stay on the clock face amazon is about to get this one back hands free calling in the house i misplace my cell phone all the time so this is a real blessing really enjoying the streaming music got for elderly parentseasy for them to usejust instructions could be more informative this thing is great fantastic alarm clock we love using it for bedtime reading on audible its very kidfriendly and i can see liking it in the kitchen while i m cooking since its small and unobtrusive we like it better than our echo dot very nice gadget love its look not happy with the spot reset numerous times seems to be in slow mode have to be practically on top of it for it to hear me even after talking with support i still do not have themes in the menu to choose from husband loves it love it love the spot   awesome little guy with precise video   i m saving to buy one for my mom on the   the spot changes everything as far as keeping your loved ones connectedwell worth all is fine with the spot exact for massive failing in order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk   which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like yes you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i swiping up rather than touching screen when you are asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss then you completely delete your recurring alarmthis is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off but as the clock has been out for now and they still have nt adding this setting clearly not going to happen this may be the biggest product design screw up amazon has ever made excellent item returned for repair receivded item back from repair   parts missing no power cord includedplease advise awesome item that i had to buy for as awesome as the and echo dots are the spot is a disappointment there is very little control over what the screen shows what the clock looks like what order things show up in etc at this point if i had nt thrown the box away immediately i would have sent it back and just got another full size echo it has replaced my clock and google mini on my nightstand outstanding little device i hope an update will give a simple face and font color options for the clock i love the echo spot it every ting i thought it would be plus more this will be going to my mom right after i get through playing with it the most fascinating thing i ve ever bought sound quality is less than a dot microphones do nt pick me up as well as the other models i have echo and dots picture quality is good awesome cute and smart product forces user to review alexa things to try there is no way to disable it absolutely love it after much persuasion from a friend i finally gave in and bought one lets just say that the moment alexa enters my life i turn around and tell siri to get the hell out i love love love it great this is my alexa device and it is so fun to discover all of the ways to use it the biggest con with me is the dropin feature its pretty creepy the best thing since sliced bread ca nt be used as a baby monitor which is why i had purchased it i did nt realize this until i read the reviews on the alexa skill for syncing the nest cam considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix surprised amazon has nt upgraded the software to allow of viewing or alerts like you get on the nest app would be 5 stars if you could turn off the things to try screen i should have read up on this before buying the spot amazon please update to enable us to turn this off it is so extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see things to try love it so great to use i own 3 of these amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool you can customize the screen contents but you can not turn off there advertising things to try people will suggest that you can but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable optionmoreover they should increase the size slightly and improve the audio speaker that would give you a 5 star deviceright now i m debating whether to return all devices my wife says we should i never thought i was going to be that person that is completely connected i purchased this and another echo product on and fell in love i have one in my office and one in our kitchen i have already used this for briefings from the news while i am getting ready for as well as look up recipes the screen is big enough for me to easily read writing this was a concern for me i loved this so much i purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools note i did purchase camera covers even though there is a button to turn off the camera and microphone and it does nt impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about there are work around love love love this i have an echo and several echo dots but love the video with this and the clock i no longer have to wake up and say alexa what time is it or alexa weather i can even watch videos on it if i forget my kindle before bed after purchasing my echo spot to add to our other amazon echoesi am very pleased with the echo spoti use it with our arlo security cameras and ring video doorbell and works without any problems disconnects often it does so much more than i knew when i bought it it pretty much runs my house helps me fall asleep takes care of my schedule and entertainment love love so far i just received it i unwrapped it set it up   immediately programmed it no problem with the reoccurring things to try i set it to rotate once and shows time like i want i love the low ambient look at this is the best alexa enabled device you can get it is so versatile and useful it sound way better than the dot but not as good as the regular echo the screen makes all the difference in the world i needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly i am a believer in amazon echo alexa and fire great customization options and alexa is always helpful sound quality is also surprisingly good you re going to have to shell out for the stand that should come with it so you can angle it best for how ever you are using this my biggest gripe i already spent an arm and a leg on this it should come with the stand love it except that amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual i do nt have to research websites plus more instruction from alexa on skills would be great we often get the answer i do nt know that skill even though i ve added it in the app ie kwikset or pizza hut such a handy item to have on my night stand she reads to me at night and gets me all set for in the morning with my calendar and weather views    i got this on prime day and figured i d see what all the hype is about honestly i did nt really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird but honestly i love it like it or not this is the way the world is going so why noti loved it so much i ordered 2 i did nt get the show because it looks like it came from and is downright ugly i have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway so the spots screen does not bother me   although it is very clearalexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere my favorite part about this is having it in our living room where its hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar   where i can just say play any song i want and it will i guess i could just pick up my smartphone to do that but you do nt know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pagesthe one thing that i am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much   they also do not rotate when playing music i d love for it to display the weather as i listen to musicthe screen is clear and i also really enjoy alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be   there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to different places that you program and name so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents   and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic i have this programmed for my parents fiances parents work and her work so it really works greatthe one thing that i actually preferred the dot over the spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications i have not seen the spot really do much for package notifications yet the dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered i would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot   the dot lights up colors   why ca nt the spot   the same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for deliveryoverall its a great device that i am looking forward to integrating my home around i m already looking at dash buttons smart plugs etc and   when i become a home owner instead of renting where i ca nt tinker with my thermostat i will be purchasing a nest down the road for hvac integration the screen response time is way better than i expected sound quality is good too also its not so bright that i have to turn off the screen but it is an option i have a dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds love it i looooooove this thing   watching movies on it is a bit of a disaster because of the round screen but other than that its a great chachki toy   we gave the echo spot as a gift to my mother in law she loves it she can play music of all genres easy for her to use very easy to set up does what is said it will very satisfied so far great product need a bit a adjustment to set up spotify time weather etc in but works fine now i used it as alarm clock   music in bedroom love it i bought this to replace a dot in my bedroom already have a show and a couple of fullsized echo units in my housethe spot is okay for what it is issues minor and majorthe minor   why include the huge bezel on the front why not take that space and make the display larger a total waste of usable spacethe major one also involves the show i m very used to these devices i do nt need to see things to try whenever i use a voice command with it even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices i m not a child and i do nt need to be told a times how to play music on it and having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed why does nt amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off i want to see a clock face period not these silly nanny reminders this product just looks adorable in any room and i love it i recently just bought my mom one as a gift on and she ca nt wait to use it love my spot loving this way more than google home devices i ve been using for and if you re an amazon prime subscriber the value here is greater than google i m using to listen to free music with prime better than alternatives audible and you can even watch movies the display is a little small for lots of watching the sound should be louder and youtube needs to be available these issues put this at a to 4 stars fix one of them youtube and its a star item to alleviate sound i ve paired with a blue tooth speaker right now this sits in my living area where i think it will shine is my office desk once there are great offers i could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other amazon alexa items for my household i felt happy after adding this to my house where as i felt stupid using google home i like it as an alexa device but its small what a wonderful little alexa enabled gadget at like the analog clock face the best love it love it love it bought it on prime day then had buyers remorse but once i got it it was love at first sight i like the echo spot because it fits into my decor and i can also sing along with my favorite songs best bedside clock and assistant i have ever had omg where do i start i love this thing none bad to say works as described a get rid of the thongs to try screen numb nuts have not used it yet but i m sure its as great as the others i can not get over how amazing the echo   echo dots are this has to be some of the greatest technology that has ever came out i am very excited and happy with this it was a breeze to set up and my favorite feature is reading my kindle and going to sleep to thunderstorm music still learning to use these things they sure are smart haha she started reading a book to me yesterday get one i like the way it controls the brightness all by itself when lights are turned off at i highly recommend the spot i have it connected to the kasa camera and it is so convenient to just ask spot to show me the camera when someone is at the door love it as soon as amazon has a good sale on these again i will be getting another good job amazon but then you get indundated with things to try i am not a that needs stimulus to tell me to do things i found there is no way to turn this off except for   turning off the screen if i can not find a suitable fix for this it goes back great to wake up to music and being told the weather bought this to replace a sony dash remember those after decided to pull support from it entirely it works great for what i use it for an alarm clock a weather station background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house my biggest gripe about the device and why i knocked a star off is that you ca nt turn off the suggestions on things to try it s an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you do nt want to see as it cycles through content screens a software update or would help this improve especially full control of what we want and do nt want to see in the content rotation ca nt turn of things to try on the screen scroll this is a big promotion device for amazon packing it up and sending it back they really want to get in our heads enough already love everything about this product i bought two one for my household and one for my mother in law just so we can video chat with her and for emergency and its easy to use for older folks this thing woke me up in the middle of the night saying ready for setup it was already setup should be a simple thing to check time before asking wife not happy the echo spot is really great i just got it and is easy to set up i do have problem when the advertise it they show a screen with the time weather and your town sadly there is no way to make this the home screen the home screen is just the time i spoke to support and the wonderful lady tried and researched for to no avail i am disappointed because i wanted that screen all the time not just during an occasional screen rotate i am hoping they will do something about this other than that its great the product is attractive and somewhat useful but amazon chose to force users to view their things to try and trending this greatly depreciates the value of the product do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from amazon the echo spot has really helped me to streamline my day and be more efficient it reminds me of any appointments warns me about traffic snarls and tells me the weather every day while suggesting new music and introducing me to new artists    come on   its amaonmazing its way more than a smart speaker its my wakeup alarm my security blanket and infotainment center allinone its my connection to the world during when i m mostly sleepy or zonkedout zzzzzzz i can still access the world without my readingglasses it sounds amazing for its size it can hear me when i m far from awake mostly as they say this is a musthave device yep that is a true statement got for me and for my son on prime day we love them i want one in every room but that would be excessive in one word amazing best tech purchase i have ever made as it controls all devices in my house and even my pool i m leaving this for those who do nt have enough of an attention span to read instructions you can stop the screen rotationsswipe down on clock screenselect settingshome   clockhome cardsrotate onceproblem solved very nicely constructed my wife wanted a for the kitchen so i order a    i love this little gadget replaces my old clock basically love i can listen to music in the morning get weather updates news briefs lets me know when a amazon order is arriving   has been delivered etc yes its a little pricey but purchased it on amazon prime now during prime day and it was delivered same day for 99 httpswwwamazoncomdpb073sqyxtwrefcmcrrypprdttlsol18 i love my little echo spot i have replaced my older full size echo with this little guy the round screen is an interesting choice and i m not sure i like the look but it is growing on me the speakers could be slightly louder but all in all it is a solid echo product its not as good as siri but it still has some positives its great at playing music and setting alarms i personally felt that i paid too much for this product as it was nearly half off on literally after i purchased it so i m pretty disappointed i might still return it and get my money back   having received this as a gift i am writing my initial thoughts compared to my google home minipros way easier to setup than the google home mini i was able to connect all of my smart home device unlike google without any issues making phone calls on this was clearer for the receiver to understand mecons need to enable skills to get more functionality google home has built in functionality to search the web for answer to questions easier than the amazon echo could not connect this to youtube love it wellmade productecho spot   white installed on my back porch works very well i did have to get the wall mount for it which also works well thank god and alarm clock with an lcd that gets dim enough for me to sleep i m a very light sensitive sleeper and wind up taping black tape over all my other stuff in my bed room not this guy the alexa features are nice and listening to music at is great we enjoy falling asleep to meditation podcasts though we have to use the skill anypod to get the podcasts we like video is kinda tiny and useless at this size but that s to be expected audio quality is much better than echo dot i love this thing at first i thought it would nt stay on the clock and that i would have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and its very comfortable for the eyes easy set up love it got it and as expected its great almost a swell as my show love this thing people think i m crazy for paying this much for a glorified alarm clock but i do nt care for me waking up in a good mood is pretty important and this helps me do it so glad i do nt have to deal with my old eeaanh eeaanh eeaanh alarm very excited to say alexa turn off the lights smart plugs get here soon got a camera privacy slide for this since it is in my bedroom i absolutely love this very user friendly and i got the kasa cam to go with it to monitor my living room super easy to set up and operate i only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately i m looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces i like digital but i miss the colon in on most of them i d also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices i really have no complaints i m being nit picky at this point worth surprisingly good beefy sound out of this thing i think it might shape up to be one of my favorite echo devices i have nearly all of them   given as a gift to my wife to compliment my echo she loves it this is a gift but i have one and love it the words to songs are great and the i live the face i chose for the clock this is my favorite echo unless i am listening to music i ve had this for now and i absolutely love it its so easy to use i m basically using it as a smart alarm but it can do way more the screen quality is great and it looks super cute sitting on my night stand i do nt know how i lived without it so long if you ca nt decide whether to buy it or not go for it you wo nt regret it fairly useless bought the spot and loved it within it started acting funny and would stop workingcalled and they determined that it was overheating i was told to unplug and technical support would call within waited without response and replied to email and was asked to wait goes by with absolutely no response so i do the inline chat per instructions told to wait longer really unacceptableexpected more from amazon find it funny how they always thank me for being a prime member but when an issue arises i can not even get assistance much easier to use than the dot it picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding the screen is a nice perk but i only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed the screen is too small to watch showsit displays my alarm in print so i know alexa heard me correctly and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures my only complaint is that they do nt add the stand as standard i did nt need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bedmany people complain about the basic alexa program but it is still such new tech that i m not going to split hairs the echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing now alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice i think amazon is working overtime on this project i gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anythingi am so used to my alexa that i talk to her even when i m staying in a hotel and she s no where to be found alexa what time is it alexa when we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra 30so we thought why not well i m so glad we did we are really enjoying our echo spot it reads stories to our girls plays music gives us the news and so much more its so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy for the size of the screen this thing should be this is of echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock i use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video much of the time it works well as alarm clock but there are some serious flaws particularly if you are the last one to bed or the to wake it does nt seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with people on different schedules try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying alexa set an alarm for and then having alexa repeat ok alarm set for not good i suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid plain and simple this device needs to be brought into and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm i know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone no thanks if i m picking up my phone to set an alarm i will just use its built in alarm and save a step at least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen so for example if you wake up early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse the interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great there should be separate snooze and cancel buttons currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels it is too easy when awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled when the snoozed alarm goes off my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while i m in the shower i bought this for my mother and she loves it i want to get one for myself now    invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to creapy af out of stars i have the original tall echo dots spots and show the only thing i m finding a problem with is the speakers in the spot when using drop in sometimes i m not being heard on the other spot and vice versa the voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent the optical is fine its just the sound sometimes ill have to repeat the wake word times and i m only 8 feet away plus its on of those stands i find the echo dot original echo and the show has much better sound quality that s reason i bought the echo show i bought this for my grandmother and she and i love it she can call all her family members with just her voice play games even watch a video and i love that i can drop in on her any time to see how she is doing she lives all by herself and i feel comfortable if there was an emergency she could call out to alexa for help    i love this thing it plays my books from audible or prime music and sets my alarms if you re considering purchasing one get it its worth it i think it can read my mind perfect love my spot my favorite feature is the alexa start i love that i can hear the weather traffic and even the word of the day it even goes right into my favorite podcast while i get dressed works replaced my expired bedside radioalarmit took me a while to realize that option setting involved using it as a touch screenmaybe it should said something during the setup process works great i love it grand daughter digs the watching of cartoons on it lol gift for husband great i had just said to myself how i desired an assistant when i came across the spot as a mom of things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyones schedules   my own i just verbally tell alexa what reminder or timer i need set and voilahaving my spot has given me the virtual assistant i so desired without having to actually hire someone not to mention the many other awesome features i have alexa synced with my audible   kindle   alex can read a book from my libraries to meim still excited to see what else my spot can doside note i had wanted to purchase a show for a while   probably still will down the line however i sooooo love my sleek little sopt i love the product   but very disappointed once i realized i can no longer play youtube videos i m now past my 30 days return date i am realizing i now have an expensive alarm clock i am hoping youtube comes back i was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during glad i did nt i m not sure why or how amazonia asking me about this purchase i got it as a gift from my kids for mothers day it was not bought from my account lil bit creepy   i have nt really had much use for it as no one calls they text so that part meh the other things it does are no different than the other alexa products i love love love love it i feel like i have a talking computer that tells me everything love the echo show being able to see the lyrics of the songs as they play or to be able to put a recipe up on the screen is wonderful it seems to work well unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because as many have mentioned it does not work with google or youtube any more this problem is caused by google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these this even effected my smart tv anyhow we purchased a few of these to communicate with our children and grandchildren so well see what happens when we hand them out love listening to music still trying to learn everything it does very pleasedsimple to figure out just what i expectedalready have other shows very good excellent to listen to my music my audio books and look all my cameras in and around my house alexa is fun i ve added smart home aspects my friend listens to spotify my husband enjoys interacting too tremendous way to communicate with friends and family all across the country itiswhat it is and than some sounds great too ony thing i do nt like the camera being seen by anyone working for amazon i asked echo show to show me camera and did nt know what i was saying but knows how to turn camera on and off but ca nt dhiw u what s recording hmm used for personal use we like hearing weather news from and various playlists love it i like the echo show its the best big screen you can watch movies preview from the movie and alexa will answer all your question you name it prime day pricing was good but the show is very limited no video services available except amazon video no netflix or youtube alexa is very limited also not nearly as useful as google works great has great picture easy to setup and use the fact that she can help me find my phone when i am at home alone is worth the price of this device i love this item i underestimated this item i have another 2 in my cart   but i m waiting for the same deal again i highly recommend this item i love using my echo show for music it sounds amazing unfortunately the video quality when video chatting is nt great my husband and i video chat often and his video comes out very clear on my end but he says my image is very pixelated i m still learning to use it but so far so good love it    oh i love my echo show and the video news spots waste of money over the echo generation 2 you do nt really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on facetime or skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the photo and will not leave it no matter what you do i have even looked online to research articles and can not find a solution i have also had problems with this device shutting down and i have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices price difference is just not worth it no you tube would nt have bought it if i known that this is our echo show we have a home in and one in the usa now when one of us is in the other home we can easily stay in touch and see each other we can also drop in on the houses when we are nt there to check on them we use it to turn on and off the lights and security systems in both homes we also have echo dots in various rooms we love all this technology we ask her many questions and she plays music for us needs to play youtube and prime video and maybe netflix but it has good sound we love our echo show great product i love this device i upgraded from the echo spot i just wish i could customize the clock on my screen to analog to mimic what i was used to in the echo spot also there is better sound quality on this device love this thing best toy i ve bought myself in awhile so far i have a smart plug connected running my and the wifi light bulbs baseball scores weather are cool but the music is the best feature this thing is a lot cooler than i thought it would be i mostly have used it to read me audiobooks but i also love that i can see into the camera while i m at work i m really enjoying this product love the flash briefing the timers the weather reports and more we love the show it loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an show issue or our internet issue but overall we use it for many applications works well with optional cameras conferencing is good still feel like bezos is spying on me i can connect my smart lights and my phone and any other smart device its just so convenient that i highly reccomend it to anyone who have the disposable income love love love love all my echo products i like the video phone feature on this can check in on our cat when on vacation works exactly how you would expect right out of the box i love being able to not only hear but now see what i need on this device i loved my regular echo but the show is just so much better it works wonderfully for music especially paired with the amazon music account and is perfect with my ring doorbell love it i absolutely love this i have it in my kitchen so i can use it for cooking the speakers are amazing i ve only had but so far so good we are enjoying it love the product idea super easy to set up   get started a breeze to do routine tasks set alarms timers add items to shoppingto do lists play music get news just about anything its supposed to do the sound is good where imhave it sitting not tinny at all as some have found there is one thing i hate   it would keep me from recommending it to anyone   you can not delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask alexa unless you have her turn off the screen totally which i do when i go to bed and its too bad bc its like a continuously running advertisement or setup guide not attractive the echo show was on sale prior to prime day for less than the echo so i figured i was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with because of the ever present script its not a nice device to look at i would not buy it again or recommend   go with the echo i may still exchange the product very excited to see what it can do this is great for music video calling kitchen timers and probably a bunch more the only reason i gave it 4 instead of stars is because of the everfloating things to try on the home screen this is purely an aesthetic complaint but hopefully soon amazon allows the option to shut it off i love the idea is the star trek computer at home the skills are great but the natural language work is mediocre got this as a gift so cool i can view my news recipes or shopping lists and much more i do love it was easy to set up so far but i wish it has a little more in the set up instructions there is still a whole lot more i would like to be able to do with it and i have no idea if i can or not with it but i really do like it this is my second one i have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home officeit is amazing for a quick look up while i am working i live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointmentsi will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family the gift of organization and information at a voice command away    do nt waste your money i own an echo gen 1 and echo gen 2 and a dot they all do a far better job of voice recognition that the echo show in fact it is so bad that it is virtually useless also the speaker is incredibly bass heavyso much so that it is hard to understand voices i ve worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble but it still sounds awful finally the screen just does nt add much i ca nt see if from across the room it rarely activates in any meaningful way and when it does nt it is more of a distraction than a helpusing facetime is so much more practicalthan using the show i m surprised amazon did nt make this a little more useful than it is perhaps in the future but for now it is a waste of time and money i love it it does everything thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality not much better than the echo dot not worth the money i purchased echo   i love this product i would definitely recommend i m loving my new echo show the video screen adds so much more value and potential movies tv shows song lyrics all extra features that are available with the echo show oh it also has a built in camera for taking pics my wife has been using skype for to talk to her parents with constant technical issues since her father is its a lot to ask the man to uninstallreinstallreconfigure skype but he does when i saw these on sale i jumped on them my wife was resistant to learn a new technology but i told her these just work   like the video phones i saw at the worlds fair in   agoyesterday it set up quickly and worked fine with no issues my wife told her coworker and she went out and bought for herself and her husband and one for each set of parents it just works like a telephone   imagine that bluetooth sound is great videos are crazy its an amazing device great item for knowledge directions musiclaughter and more very niceneeds some work very cool enjoy using it great sound love the shopping list the echo show is ok however the constant suggestions about what to ask alexa are sooooo annoying and there is no way to eliminate it also i thought i could have the weather for an area displayed continuously but i have to talk to alexa which i do nt want to do in the middle of the night had i payed full price it would have been returned there are other features that are nice but i may never use them we held off purchasing an echo but could nt resist during the echo works great and its nice to have the screen there is still a lot more we need to learn how to do    love it very much still learning everything that my echo can do but am really enjoying the whole process love it still learning all the possibilities i love the echo show awesome speakers i love the fact when you listen to music the words come up all around liking it so far also being able to read what s on your shopping list to do list and notifications nice works great easy to set up and sooooooo many things it can do just awesome met every expectation i had i like it unit is working great but it is a true pia that products are shipped without user manuals do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased i have no idea of the echo shows capabilities i have it linked to my hue lights but have no idea what commands will work and what wo nt i purchased a fire tv stick along with the show but have no idea how to maximize the just a few examplesi even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful seems way too basic to me but better than a kick in the pants its a fun item to have has a lot of udefulness big negative is that it does nt use google or any real search engine to get answers or find information i was pleasantly surprised its awesome so far alexa show is amazing my wife hated that i bought it thought we did nt need it and after a day she fell in love with alexa too lol it is so convenient for setting timers listening to music playing music for the dog while i m not home connecting to bluetooth speakers for parties playing movies i love it do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either it rarely gets what i say correct does not control the dish receiver yes i set it up correctly using the alexa app on my phone we got this for which is a good deal ti is definately not worth the price though maybe in another month it will get better or either i have one that is just deaf and dumb really can not recommend this item at the current time it makes talking with your grandchildren so easy especially for the little ones outstanding product great product i already had purchased the echo and a couple of dots and hesitated to purchase this until the price dropped i am very glad i did the versatility of the video screen is outstanding no regrets i purchased the show   to keep in touch with my daughter and her family after their recent move way across the country it is wonderful seeing their faces during our conversations my difficulty is i do nt have a cell phoneand now you ca nt download the alexa app on a mac book air so i am stuck unable to program my echo show properly in my opinion you should be able to tell the echo show what you need done and the echo show does it every time i ask for something i am referred back to the alexa appon your mobile device which i can not accessto me this is not intelagence but dependence on other equipment to functionevery thing is pushed to the phone because the phone has been made accessable to all those who wish to gather information great in the kitchen i love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes also great for listening to music and watching shows on amazon prime video while i cook i subsequently bought an echo dot with the ihome clock docking station for the bedroom i created a group so i can play music on both of them at the same time i plan to add more speakers in the future excellent quality very good sound great deal on prime day so far so good neat to have a visual version of alexas responses nice to see the lyrics of music you are listening to flash briefings have good videos speaker is much better than a dot but not the highest quality its fun fun so far learning to use her works great nice sound and picture this product is even better than i imagined i love the timer setting it reminds me to put the clothes in the dryer if i ask it to and i love shopping list feature my family enjoys the games too its made my life a little more easy alexa is my personal assistant   i love it very disappointed alexa does nt hear me and does nt respond to my requests highly like my eco showno complaints love it so glad we got it on although now having it i would totally pay full price for it great addition to the alexa family nice having the visual part of pics recipes etc we love it we use it every day and are finding new ways to use it the longer we have it i have been through shows now and all of them have been broken it has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders i do nt have these issues on my dot or my echo just on the show it would be nice if amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing easy set up pleased with the echo it is loud and can hear my voice and understand much better than previous versions love it great to request music and be able to see lyrics i had a dot but this is so much better what we liked most was actually seeing the words to song least would be i guess i expected a little more from her than is currently available i m just learning about this product but what i know i love   easy to use it does what it needs to i love this product i m not very computer literate but everything is voice controlled i use this to keep in touch with my daughter she lives out of town now we just drop in on each other its like we are living net door to each other i enjoy seeing lyrics on the screen for different amazon music stations love the echo show great in kitchen for recipes alexa is pretty dumb   only problem is my slow internet i really like the speaker on it having tons of fun with it love my echo show alexa is amazing and now on the show she can display lyrics photos etc the speakers are amazing and fills the room bought on so got a great deal so worth it love my echo show everything about this device is wonderful used to have fun with great to play music turn on lights and who know what else works great   seems to be a delay bringing up ring cameras but sound and video quality are good works on great i use it with my arlo security system this is so fun i really enjoy using it i have it hooked up to one of my lights so i just tell alexa when i want that on and off also it connects to my spotify so i just have alexa resume my playlist and we pick off right where we ended i feel like there s even more i can do with this so i m excited to use it more upgraded from an original echo on prime day and so far i love it i m sure i have a long way to go to maximize its utility but for now i owe my marked increase in lyrical knowledge to this thing who knew post malone actually used words you ca nt access youtube why do consumers have to pay for this argument why ca nt we just have a good product that offers what we need    still learning about the echo show but so far we love it my loves to cook and especially with his aunt that lives out of state and now he can connect with her and they cook together i love having this on my desk the fact that i can video with friends listen to music with the words right there and see my amazon cloud cam feeds from one location is pretty spectacular i got this one sale too which was stellar it has me thinking i need another one for the front room love it love my echo show great sound and picture does a great job thing in my entire echo collection ca nt change voice of echo does everything i could ask and more great product i like how clear the screen is hi resolution it is so easy to use and is everything i hoped for i love the echo show i m going off to live on campus for school in the fall and we got of these to serve as an easy way to connect some people might not like the camera but that makes little sense we carry devices with cameras all the time the only difference here is that the item is stationary my family and i also find the dropin feature a comfort rather than an invasion of privacy its definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versaid also like to thank amazon for including their voiceview screen reader on the device the show would be a lot less blind friendly even with alexa present if they had nt included thatwe are an echoloving household with dots echos and now two shows i would nt be surprised if we got more in the future for ourselves or loved ones thanks amazon i love it it is awesome very good to be able to listen to every single song at any time in amazons vast library were only just beginning to know everything echo show has to offer well worth the price alexa is very helpful love it great sound and the screen is nice to actually see time trivia etc this has been perfect for being able to see my canary cameras and that s exactly what i wanted i have been happy with all my alexas because we have several and this is a great addition i really love this item so much fun i agree youtube should be on there we like it a lot sound is better than the original echo the bass feels deeper the screen is cool though have nt got a lot of use out of it though good sound the capacity of join different apps to make work your smart home great addition to the alexa family just wish it could use the screen more than backgrounds do nt get me wrong i do nt regret buying it especially for the primeday sale of off sale price but for now the skills for the show are lacking i ve had previous experience with the echo dot and this just blows all previous expectations out of the waterits great since it can play videos and music from multiple sources and the speakers are pretty loud love the echo show can keep i can video chat with the kids and grandkids i have it in the kitchen so when i run out of something i have alexa to add it to my grocery list i use it for everything was very easy to set up i m really hoping for skills that take advantage of the shows touch screen there s an incredible amount of untapped potential locked behind the restrictions make use of the best part of having the show and enable skills to navigate by touch please love it l i plan on getting an echo for the kitchen it does not pick up my voice unless i yell most times great love it amazing fire hd does so much more over priced pair of speakers seems to be a good product but unable to play music in sync with my sonos system sonos does nt seem to recognize it at all great product like the apps that i can connect to it i love it now able to talk to my grandson with ease and the picture quality is great love it easy setup and i can drop in on my daughter and soninlaw who live in st louis anytime everyone loves to have their mother drop in right   fun i use this to control my smart home show has been great still learning what it can do but being able to watch videos talk face to face with others are not features wish i bought one for work too very intrusive so i turn it off love the echo show works well not thrilled that most of the apps have to be paid for seprately video calls to mom love being able to see as well as hear things sound is better too i love it just like any other echo does nt disappoint nice picture good sound but the mics are not as sensitive as a dot my dots can hear me from across the house the show does not that being said i love the showi can watch tv and movies while in tg ed kitchen have the news playing or musicloveit   i basically use it to play music and tell me the newsits sometimes hard to communicate with it if i do nt say the command correctly but i realize its learning my style of speaking and will do some commands even though i do nt say them exactly as i should    upgraded from echo to echo show i love the echo show i have the dot and have been using that for but the show is so much better the sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini tv i love being able to see my timers events and list instead of having them read to me i purchased this on prime day and it is worth when the dot was given to me i thought this is a cute novelty but ill probably never use it was i wrong echo is part of my daily routine and has made my life so much easier so far i m very pleased with my echo show the problem is there s so much it can do that i have nt been able to explore the extent of its abilities i got the special price as part of the prime day promotionand you just ca nt beat what you get for the price very pleased with the sound the video screen is sharp sometimes it takes a few tries to get alexa to perform a commandbut as i get to know the system better i m hoping that will improve drawback in the musicive noticed a lot of the songs from past are rerecordings by the original artistbut not the original recording itself example secret agent man by is used not the original version if i m going to pay for prime musicid like to hear the original version of songsnot later recordings or at least give me a choice of what i want to hear otherwise i am very pleased with my echo show so pleased in fact that i bought a second one i like everything about this   i m still learning how to use it its like having another kid in the house i have to constantly repeat myselfi can tell alexa to do something clear as day and according to the history she hears something comeletely differentthe device is really cool and i like the concept which is why it gets stars however it just does nt work as intendedi find myself irritated more often than not when i use this device really easy to use its great sound and video quality the way the music sounds is poor quality it does everything the echo does and more although i have nt and probably wo nt use the video functions i had hoped that the display would be allow for more customization it does not and is very limited i would like the clock and weather to display in large text all of the time it only displays in very small text it also always has a line that says tell alexa to do this or that tips at the bottom of the screen i would like to see that go away but it wo nt sound quality is good not as good as the big echo but good enough i bought it on sale and think i got value for what i paid i would have been disappointment had i of paid full price love my echo show i enjoy this thing its learning am very happy now that i can see all of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account asking any echo device to play music on sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly this went on for until i eventually solved the problem that neither amazon nor sonos could figure out so far i like it it is better than i expecting it does nt always respond to the wake word this is my echo product and i have to say i am a little disappointed alexa voice assistant is great when it comes to controlling a connected home but has a lot to learn from google assistant when it comes to getting answers for search queries good product after i am not sure if i like the ever present alexa to have a screen as well i bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera and that works but the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off   instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video there is something about only audio that made alexa different no i some ways it is a tv that you can talk to it f sucks    love being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs this thing is awesome for grocery lists paired with the anylist app the flash briefing is very good too my only complaint is that once you pause something alexa decides that you no longer want to listen to that thing forever all in all definitely worth the purchase works great video call function nice when communicating through dropin    as you can see echo show is in kitchen it far exceeds my expectation there s a wealth of information about any topic if is customizable for sound and video i also have echo and echo dot you can group them and have hole house music still not done exploring all it can do love it perfect for getting recipes so you can see them while you re preparing to cook fairly easy to use absolutely love my echo show it is awesome and works great with my ring video spotlight cams music on demand and so many more features that i have yet to explore absolutely love it i use it for everythingi tell my friends and clients that its the daughter i never had i ask her to do something and she does nt complain i wish i bought the deal   i truly needed one in my work room i kick myself for it we love having this in our kitchen very convenient to look up recipes listen to the news or watch prime video while i m cooking always wanted onetill i got one its not at all what its cracked up to be its hard to navigate i actually like the dot better the greatest love it this is my echo original and dots its the best decent speaker fun graphics i loved talking it out of the box and being able to easily set up easy to setup and use the ability to play video is huge addition on alexa device family echo show is said to work with certain apps butnot cozi state works with echo show but the cozi familys does nt very well amazon needs to go back to drawing board it would be such a needed piece of technology but it lacks the essential please fix cost of the echo show was marvelous   got echo show to take on shopping list but that is all so far adding items to list has long lag and it not my router being slow my provider speed is gb speed not a problem but before new items is updated on cozi is very slow help is needed to get it updated to a1 working conditioning all the music i can listen too also the movie i can watch i can see my ring doorbell   no enough video options great sound i took advantage of prime and decided to take a chance and purchase one i enjoy the features it comes with i m sorry i did nt purchase of them well worth the money its looks great on my nightstand every night it puts me to steep with sleeping music happy customer the musicthe shopping list and the sound diversity so many things to see and hear wealth of information love it thanks amazon you guys rock disappointed that this device is not able to access youtube as of i was nt aware of that when i purchased it i ve had problems with my device the voice stops working throughout the day i can see it trying to respond to me because the window it opens contains the info i asked about but its like the device gets stuck in the process it stops working and the blue bar just flashes i keep having to unplug and restart the device once i do that it starts working again so irritating this device could really be a great device if google and amazon would act like grownups returned from repair with no repair done it has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itselfi sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed the site gives no option to complain from the pagei have a echo spot which works perfectly in the same position love it i like the design and the visuals i have nt had my show very long or used it a lot but i love it i use it to set timers when cooking because my stove is being finicky and not wanting to work most of the time i also use it to check for different recipes listen to music and my all time favorite telling everyone it is time for dinner my son gets a real kick out of thati know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment but remember the original echo did nt have what it has now when it came out i see that amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon i am sure it will have all that we want very soon maybe even things we have nt thought ofi do wish it was a bit more user friendly i still have nt figured out how to video chat with my cousin in who also has one and when i tried to call my sons dot it went to video chat immediately last i looked dots do nt have video screensanother thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill i had enabled that was free so now he is a bit worried to use it again that needs to be fixedi do have to say that all in all i am very happy with my echo show i have not had it very long its my alexa thing i sure like what i have done with it so far there is a lot to learn and play with works great and has been fun to use this is the best of my echo devices and i own a spot a dot and echo having the large screen really majes this an enjoyable experience only thing its missing is youtube easy to use i bought it to go with my security camera system but it did not perform like i thought it would it does nt alert us when someone is at the door also i ca nt talk to the person at the door through the echo show only through my cell phone great device features are awesome the interaction is fantastic home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly my only issue is out of echo shows of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching these are and already having issuesfirst repairs were sent off and they updated the firmware when i got the device back nothing worked i had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again then the glitch starts up againi love the show but i m getting really frustrated with the glitching super fun   i ty is what i was expecting    i love this so much alexa is even better when she can show you things i have the echo but got show 1 for my daughter absolutely love it especially for the video chat i ve had an alexa dot for some time but i m really enjoying the alexa show its great to have a visual whether its a song or the weather played jeapordy but i m not good at it you do learn trivia and no ones watching love that recipes are visible and movies are available have nt had it long enough to try everything got this on amazon prime with the ring pro work really great being the lazy guy i am i do nt need to go see who at my door anymore while i m gaming we originally got the show to video chat family members and it works great for that we have found that we really like checking things handsfree like the weather and recipes so far we have really liked the show and would recommend it easy setup was up and running in the learning feature is outstanding now i know why amazon is so far ahead of the competition i bought this product hoping that alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along therefore expecting her to be responsive this 100 piece of crap does nt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her echo buttons manual see step the device has potential given it has a big screen decent sound but for i would never reccomend it even for the 100 i spent i feel like i got shorted oh and lastly the device is pretty useless without a prime membership i linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker i went on the family account this one and got it to work minimal oh and even with our prime membership you have to have a music pass or something that s an extra a month leaving this item a subscription nightmare and a overpriced decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes i would give it zero stars if i could quite niceclear great sound versatile use can watch movies or news able to use as remote for vehicle or use as a communication hub for the home great produc i bought two one for me and one for my daughter who lives in another state we love it our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a fullfledged tablet what fantastic potential these have   for digital photo screen video calls easy accesss to music audio books etc however once we have them setup we discovered the huge lurking negative amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their alexa features you can turn off many other things in settins but you can not turn off things to try instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time   we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says try   amazon please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this spam the best part about owning this is that my mother who is antitechnology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well well done its my second one so i put this one in the kitchen for recipes echo show is perfect for staging in the kitchen so recipes are right there no need to print them wonderful device acoustical sounds are not as powerful as our tall cylindercal echo but we have that covered in the adjacent family room great fun but frustrating at times commands between tv and the show get mixed asking to watch something will turn my directv not display on show which stinks with an also would like more video options with flash briefings still really a tech wonder for a low price love that you can play music and see the lyrics connected to my echo dot i enjoy listening in multiple rooms i love alexa and when i had the chance to add show to my home i jumped at it but i m a member and my show does nt know i paid for the extras with my echo now in the upstairs bedroom if i am supposed to pay more for having show added to my home then i m afraid to ask what s the point purchased as a more personal contact vehicle for engaging with long distance grandchildren works perfectly in every regard resolution and sound both better than expected highly recommend works well pictures awesome sound could be better must be on the same bandwidth as other alexa devices for whole home music 24ghz vs 5ghz i am pleased with the echo show from the sound of the music and the words to the tunes to the news and weather the color on the screen for my photos could be better echo show is my personal assistant awesome the packaging was beautiful and then there she was we have dots and an echo plus already now we have the show and we love it an echo for each roomyou can also say alexa turn off the screen and it will go black this is good for sleeping the ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by google search has spoiled had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the echonot so the ability of alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the packageperhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates my daughter has an echo show and she told me how much she loved it i bought a white one for my kitchen and absolutely love it it has all the features of the others plus great extras the sound system is awesome i also own the original echo tower dots and spot each are great and have their uses around my house i highly recommend all of these products really like the show me feature i also like video calls with others i love this device i bought it simple so that i can have an alarm clock with my amazon echoand during for the price you could nt beat it but i have sonos and big ass fan lights that i am able to control with this device its perfect and getting better all the time the ase of participating with echo i like the weather options but alexa search compacity needs improvement she ai nt no google alexa gets our requests probably of the time currently alexa does nt do youtube either this is a huge drawback and why the echo show dropped in price international radio via tune in is awesome but again her search engine its like pulling teeth to get to anything love it love i still have nt figured out all the best things we can do with it easy to use answers all my questionshands free what s not to like   it may not be perfect but it is a sign of the times to come can be connected to smart home items i enjoy it totallly keeps your home connected this product is amazing i love it best buy only thing missing is bluetooth its great the echo show works great i enjoy very much works with blink video cameras does not work with you tube i love the simple set up i love the fact that it has all the answers to most of the questions that i have i bought one for everybody in my family so we can all be like the jetsons the only draw back is it stops every once in awhile in the middle of a song   great product echo is my teacher english he is very funnybut sometimes he does not listen to what is said ight awesome product i am in the process of having every room in my house set up with automation and the show is now my favorite device we ve had the original echo for quite some time and just recently added the show it was simple to setup and more inviting to use with the visual interface the echo is being used as the primary interface for my connected home system which is currently only controlling lights and switches i look forward to expanding on that capability we also use it for maintaining lists as a music player general information and entertainment i have nt used the show to shuffle through our favorite photographs but will start that soon these things are great bought of these one for my kitchen and the other for my sewing room its great if i need a recipe or need to know how to do something i am still learning everything it can do love how it shows the song info on the screen if playing also time notifications news etc alexa takes some getting used to but the picture quality is great the touch screen is very responsive and smooth speakers are better than expected as wellfour stars out of love it i like the option for white but its bizarre that it comes with a black cord i have a white kitchen so now i have this standsoutlikeasorethumb black power cord for aesthetic purposes i was happier with my yearold white echo not show because it came with a white powercord this seems like a major design flaw in the white option i strongly urge amazon to change out the powercord to white i am very pleased with the echo show i love that it has so many nice features i highly recommend it the ease of set up and overall functionality makes this echo show worth i especially like setting my background screen and being able to set affirmations that i use as personalized reminders i love it i wanted it primarily for the kitchen in addition to other common services i wanted it to use allrecipes and cooks illustrated recipes easy to use great for recipes listen to music see movies movie trailers so much to do i love being able to see information that alexa gives when notifications are turned on it lets you know when your order will be delivered and it also tells you what the order is you can use the echo screen to pull up details of your orders you can use the alexa skill to make calls from uhyour echo great sound and video really like it love my echo show now i can listen to music get recipes and so much more i highly recommend the echo for everyone easy to set up plug it in then make some selections for your preferences such as language temp c or f etc i am getting more familiar with it and will be adding my calendar and appointments i like the variety of stuff that the echo show offers i love it i wish it did more with internet searches i do like the feature it has i bought this after visiting a friend who had one and it is great i understand the frustration of not having youtube though still good to havelove seeing the words to songs and if you have the ring doorbellyou never have to get up from your chairlaziness at its best lol all in all a great product with good speakers good smart home gadget love the speakers and the screen no youtube i loved everything about this item quick response time and very sensitive to me speaking from the other end of the house bought it for my mother it is great but it would be better there was a way to use headphones with it so far so good much better sound than my echo dot clear screen and great picture i love it it is compatible with many of my cameras and it does everything that the echo dot does i have it in the kitchen great for news or music in the am i can video call my daughter and grand kids i really dig it i absolutely love this thing and i love amazon because my echo show went bonkers and all it took was a brief chat and voila a new one to replace it is on the way i was floored when the screen started blurring and shaking and jumping and missing part of its data alexa still talked but i could nt watch movies so happy that amazon is so easy to deal with and makes good on its products without any hassle at all works well for recipes and references nice device just the right size works well works fine i just realize i do nt need this because i do nt use it it has a screen microphones speaker and alexa lives inside yup it is an echo show expectations met this is very user friendly   lets start withdislikes now i want to buy more to have them all over my housedo i even need to add my likes now hahaawesome fun and useful nothing else to say an outstanding piece of technology i use it everyday for information scheduling and general information awesome amazon keep improving with ai this was an impulse buy and i am super happy i made the purchase i love this so much i immediately bought my parents one now we can video chat easily i love all the features and how easy this is to use and set up i like it great product great price on thanks alexa still trying to figure out how to link to bluetooth speaker wish there were more skills still learning it we have just started integrating the smart devices in our home with the echo product line we now have the show the spot dots and a kids dot having trouble getting them to call each other but still working on it great improvement over the original echo like the ability to see lyrics to songs watch prime tv and get other visuals the little hints about things to try that appears across the bottom sparks the imagination love it sound is greatvideo is great now i just need to learn everything it can do where can i see videos youtube listen to music watch the news great addition to our alexa family great video also if you belong to amazon prime i would think that you could watch any video on it that was in the library you can with prime music starting my day nothing to dislike and it does a lot more than i expected i bought this specifically so my wife could look at our arlo security cameras from the bedroom when i m at work the system worked for and now it just gives me a error message very disappointed due to the fact that they advertise that these systems work together i gave stars because it does everything else very well love it it is awesome i love being able to turn my lights on so i do nt have to walk into a dark home i also get to video chat with my nephews who live states away by just asking alexa to call super easy set up great features fun i love the size and the videos are a good quality the sound is awesome too home bought for my older grandparent to help with reminders would recommend to anyone with someone in their life with dementia or memory loss helps my grandmother remember to take medications and do daily task she loves it because she can listen to music and ask questions kids like it for games showing the lyrics for songs is neat need to be able to connect to more party viceo apps glad i upgraded my aka still leaning about it the price was right i own dots a tap and a show i love the echo show sound quality is amazing compared to the dots i use mine constantly to create shopping list kitchen and laundry timer and news updates but most of all i have the all throughout the house and i play music throughout using the group settings i absolutely love my show echo show   white great new addition to our alexa home solution and now i can call back home and video chat directly from my phone great way to stay in touch with family its an echo with a screen hence still needs work has me considering google home now great product i like the fact that the messages are visual now as well as audiblei am puzzled because it will light up and make the notification sound but when i ask alexa to read my notifications she tells me that there are no new notifications this has happened at least once a day for over a week now while i loved alexathis is a whole new level love it fun to watch movie trailers weather is so much more complete when you listen to musicthe lyrics appear still discovering all echo show can do highly recommend takes alexa to a completely new world nice product but as intelligent as we thought or had hoped the tech is nt there it does nt understand most common words and is basically a glorified radio    love it we have other echoes and love those so i bought this on prime day no regrets love that i can connect to my ring and see the front door yhe kids like seeing the lyrics to songs and sing along   i love it plays great music movies and so much more i does lag when u want to see your arlo security cameras thou so far so good wish it had a longer cord love the echo show the video quality is good and of course sound is good too love it it is in my kitchen so i can watch prime video while cooking love all of it great product we are very pleased with this item the display is clean and crisp and easy to read we enjoy trying the suggested things to try asking alexa we use the timer feature quite a bit and have added our calendars and contacts we are still exploring the many skills available device has great speakers and the screen quality is phenomenal we now have a dot spot echo and show and love the show and spot best the show has great sound and my wife loves the display for weather recipes and sing alongside super deal it does nt play you tube videos was working great util algo i have it for but it started flickering and in the support forums they say it is a known isue but it has more reported and there is no solucion we like the video calling feature we got this so we can be in contact with our elderly parents and it works well the sound on these is terrible its like a tin can i love my echo but this item is awful i have been waiting for the echo show to go on sale and it was worth the wait it was easy to set up and start using bought this on prime day this was my echo device 1st echo show it seemed to have huge potential and i really wanted to like it but soon found out it is quite limited a bit disappointing but not the end of the world i used it like i use my other screenless echos for when the screen started flickering mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just a quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement as some people had devices replaced only to start flickering again shortly after amazon are not providing any serious answers and this has been going on for quite some time apparentlylong story short i moved it to the hallway and been using it as a very expensive and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights so like the headline suggests meh love it to play music works great for finding recipes need more family to have adapted machines to see it seems a little less intuitive then the regular echo plus its also a little harder for it to pick up what you re saying when combined with the other we have in the household having to speak loud enough for it to hear was cross activating other ones so we had to rename this one overall it works well but does not seem as adept at doing things as the original echo plus this is my show i like them very much i use mine for music and my arlo security cameras i can connect and display my outdoor cameras by voice they are exceptionally capable devices i highly recommend them love seeing everything in the display i love this thing i enjoy watching the news play music with lyrics most songs ordering my coffeeetc we use alexa primarily for listening to music and checking the weather we are still learning other ways to use her everything has been ready and hands free so far the speaker has great volume and sound plug n play set up is simple added battery base to make it portable looking forward to using the hub great speaker i n this i love this so much more than my alexa tap its definitely fast in response and just so much prettier she s alexa a bit dense and still learning the way i phrase things with my nynj regional accent great sound and easy to set up purchased the echo plus because it had a built in hub and would make it easier to connect to devices i am hooked on alexa i like the built in hub plus the unit sounds great just wish it had a volume control on it happy with echo plus having fun learning what i can do with it love my new echo plus omg we love it have had this around a week i love that i can control items in my house even if i m not there makes me feel better about being away from the house and people do nt know that we are gone alexa has not disappointed i did not know it needed to be plugged in to work so far my experiences have been positive    was surprised to learn this can be used as a bluetooth speaker for phones and tablets it probably lists it in the description but i missed that part it not quite the surroundlike quality of a bluetooth speaker in the range but its very good none the less and with even basic access to amazon music there is a lot to listen to there s a huge number of things alexa can do learning more every day its fun to use i love novelty gadgets and alexa really works well for me    awesome device to have in home full of very useful information do nt have to us e my phone to answer spur of the moment questions i like the echo plus its wonderful the least thing i do nt like is it does nt turn off every we love our echo plus we like listening to musicthe sound is great all the features are nice i do wish it was wireless so we could listen to music outside its a great product and easily set up just have to get it in sync with your personal set up using as a hub and music still need more ai built into it to interact better it needs to continue the conversation sometimes if the finding   answer needs to be right you ca nt keep stop alexa and ask again and again also it should be able to access the wikipedia dictionary in many areas with better and fast accessneeds to hear us better also we should be able to name it on our own instead calling alexa or echo price can be reduced a bit value based and updates should be auto and daily to improve it connectivity to other home equipment can be imrproved as wellgood product with good sound quality but needs more ai built in it was an excellent purchase echo plus has sound quality good size i love it i it did take me to set it up i have a galaxy s9 phone when i got used to the system setup it was in edit my light bulbs adding a string of lights simple easy great speaker great microphone response loving my purchase and the beginning of my smart home this is my 3rd echo and with the built in hub it works great   now i have an echo in the family room my bedroom and my home office i donr know how to use it yet need more explicit directions for the electeonically challenged i did not get the feee lifht bulb that was part of the package is amazing i have all 3 and i love this awesome product very responsivealexa just needs more content and variety when it comes to music it uses the bing search engine instead of google if only the could combine it would be a perfect product i am pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of alexa the unit is very responsive and can easily respond even with tv or music playingi did pair smart bulbs and they go on off and dim with ease using voice or app is very good for the sizemy only regret is that i would have liked a silver model or a fabric cover but that is an unimportant issue we went to a best buy with the intention of buying alexa products instead were talked into the google home products bought the google home and the home mini has trouble from the start setting them up and they could nt understand my husband scottish accent after days of the oops something went wrong command we returned them and bought the amazon echo show and the echo plus so easy to set up it connected immediately to my amazon account and was way easier to navigate they both understand commands from my husband on the try and have yet to give an error message we have loved these products and should have gone with what we intended in the place you wo nt regret your purchase tons of features and skills and a very good speaker with plenty of bass for music you still need some work on the ai in responding to random questions though my android phone is far better at those with the echo i still get a lot of hmm i m not sure or i do nt have an opinion on that i like alexa so far it has been fun to use and learn how to deal with alexa i am still learning and finding out what can really be done plus i am in the process of making my house a smart house so there is no much to control with alexa yet i like the whole thing so far same specs as regular echo but easier to use than getting a separate hub for smart lights etc its a great product with many good aspects it easy to setup and control with intuitive straight forward instructions the included lightbulb was excellent and worked perfectly i very much enjoy this product and recommend it not that much different than the one we had alexa is still stubborn lol we ordered it on to get the light bulbs with it i the deal but did not get the light bulbs when we called she said they were sold out felt bad about that now we have to buy light bulbs to have ability to play amazon music outside for patio gatherings i also used blue tooth to connect echo plus via alexa app on my tablet to an external speaker whenif the party extends into the yard i have plans to connect other devices such as thermostat and other lighting and home devices we got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired   it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once i did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff   it should do text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the web by voice so he would nt feel left out and isolated   they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the echo so tech support can help setup the device   i had to get a friend who s an it guy to come help me setup i love every aspect of the echo plus i wanted it for my office the light was also for my desk lamp great hub this is very hard to review because i am part of the problemi am 75 and got it so my dog would have distracting noise when i am not homei am computer literate itunes literate amazon literate as well as countless other programs but am apparently a dunce when it comes to talking to alexa i think i heard her sigh in exasperationi tried to create a playlist of songs i like only to have it ignored i am learning workarounds but they are mediocre at bestand as yet do not include a personal playlisti have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic alexa than am iso far i like what i have been able to use but i d like it a lot more if i could configure it to my needs rather than accepting the amazonalexa defaultkaren very satisfied with the purchase the package came in good time and was just as expected great sound easy set up looks cool love the echo plus much better versatility than the generation echo intercom and voicecontrollable smart bulbs are awesome my new bff alexa did nt know answers to many questions we asked for example we asked how many cups in a pound and she said a pound is a form of money for now i love everything so cool with my music and flash briefings star echo great product i have and may want to buy so far we have enjoyed it the only problem we have is i have not been able to call one of my sons with it the sad part is he is the one who gave it to me   love it i have had no problems with my echo plus would purchase it again great i love it you own personal secretary not perfect but very good a few times alexa picked up something from tv and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things if you call something light in the app you need to say light not lights echo plus has no problems as a smart hub but i could use better user directions well worth owning and a good step to making my home smart pretty cool i have only begun to figure out things she does i have the google home that i really like the echo plus i think has even a better sound and am totally happy with it i love this device makes life easier the more you figure out it can do    i love my echo plus i have nt bad thing to say it controller music when i need it too with a great sounding 360 speaker i also bought a fire tv and it can open amazon prime video or netflix at any moment the included hue lighting makes this product even better i found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room the addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer alexa will controll it all as soon as you say hey alexa and if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device this is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort amazon music is great love the ability to create my only playlists has great sound not up to the standard of our bose but very good home entertainment great product i just wish it had some sort of equalizer the bass is a little much its work perfect an i must introduce the rest of the device to complete the functions i decided to buy smart door lock and decided on getting the echo plus to control it i chose a kwikset because amazon said it was compatible and i bought 2 dots while i was at it and when i posed the question somebody in the community said it will work with alexa what i did nt know was the zwave lock and zigbee alexa hub were nt compatible does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with echo plus if not i guess my choices are exchange the plus for a regular echo and buy a separate hub like wink 2 return the whole alexa system and get something elsei do nt want to just buy another hub to use along side my echo plus or ill be back here asking how to integrate hubsthe reason i kept from buying smart systems up to this point is because i was afraid they would nt operate seamlessly and unfortunately i only do enough research after something does nt work this echo plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life i purchased the amazon echo plus on amazon prime day because i need a hub i m in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home for the same price as some hubs and even less expensive in some other cases i got a hub that works with my devices plus it does a lot more i have nt even had time to go through all the skills it has but i ve already found myself using many of them when i started a search for a hub i was nt even considering the echo in part because i did nt know it was a hub but also because i did nt really think i would find much use for another ai system if you re looking for a hub why settle for a plane hub when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet costs the same or less than other hubs oh and by the way for the same price as the amazon echo plus alone i found one that came bundled with a smart bulb   saw another that came with a smart plug given the price of these extras well that just put the echo plus over the top i m so happy that i purchased alexa when i recently saw this at a friends home he played some music while talking about the product i love the sound   love that all i have to do is tell alexa or ask a question   she responds immediately i have nt been able to listen to my cds for a while since i have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that its not an issue any longer after we learned to use this we are still learning we are very pleased with echo plus i love it   used one like this in philly while visiting my son and decided to buy my own on prime day   the speakers on these devices are surprisingly good the functionality of each echo device is fantastic as advertised connected my smart bulbs with no problems it works perfect love warehouse buys if this was just in good used condition then new must be newer than new seriously this one was perfect not a mark on it anywhere great buy alexa is awesome i got my echo plus i found out things that she can do that i did nt think were even possible i highly recommend this product along with all the accessories ease of set up ill have fun sitting up other features as well as making my house a smart home i try use with yale lock but is nt work it seems to be ok but the instructions are weak and i can not seem to get it to work i am going to get my techy friend to help me out and i will update you later i love everything about it i love that the echo plus turns on and off my light it can also dim them with voice commands i also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that i did nt purchased audibles for i like that it can play my music from amazon music pandora tunein i heart radio and spotify echo can even play my local radio station i love that the echo is connected to my tivo bolt this allows tivo to pause stop and play whatever i want with a simple voice command i love that i can reorder items that i purchased on amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered the only three dislikes that i have is that if you re up too close or to far the echo does nt respond so i think they need to improve the microphone and i wish the speaker was better the speakers are okay but could be improved also i have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet well i received a red light right on my echo plus this error was sorry i m having trouble understanding you please try again later after research online i learned it was a problem connecting to my internet and it was easy to find this out and i found it odd that my dot was nt having this problem even though they are connected to the same network love everything about this perfect for controlling my tplink smart devises love this thing easy to setup and looking forward to adding more smart devices to my home got it specifically to work with the smart lock and it connected to it with ease definitely ties the smart home together sound very nice perfect for the price love it its number wonderful product love alexia it has a nice speaker music mainly but still checking other features very capable language recognition is the best i ve experienced great sound too love   love my echo plus   so silly simple to set up   alexa has now become my new bff amazon support is hard to beat   any questions answered any time   what more can you ask for   its got to be one of the coolest things awesome easy set up linked right up with my nexia home automation hands free voice commands and interactions with smart devices around the house makes having an echo plus one of the best purchases i ve made definitely a really good buy for time buyers of smart home stuff i bought 3   i enjoy the various functions of the device alread had echos and dots but the ability to control philips hue bulbs nudged me to buy this on another fun product from amazon i purchased the echo plus with the buildin hub so i could have the convenience of asking alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off philips hue light bulbs were placed in the fixtures that i wanted alexa to control and they all work great i already had an echo dot in my kitchenden area so i placed the echo plus with hub in my bedroom my radio and lamps in my kitchen and den are controlled with tplink plugs but the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my den and bedroom have special philips hue light bulbs that are controlled by the hub inside the echo plus i am able to play music set my alarm get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices the echo dot requires a tplink plug to be plugged into it and the echo plus requires a special philips light bulbs installed in each light fixture to work the only thing i dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with alexa and the echo plus with hub other than the high price of the bulbs i love my echo plus with built in hub easily configured hub capabilities excellent sound quality for the size of the unit works great in my large open room fun this is outstanding works awesome the music sound very clear and loud and alexa is very smart i bought this specifically for the smart hub capability so far it has been great easy set up instructions for all the various brands compatible with it the sound is wonderful and it just plain works i wish it cost less but it is worth the cost especially on prime day comes with a hub got it during prime day for and a hue white bulb works great now i can add more stuff that required a hub got it for the smart hub and does exactly was it says turn lights on and off arm and disarm my security system and the thermostat is next greatproduct very easy to set up great sound so far its been very useful trying to learn all the ways to use alexa   works better than i thought loved all about it all i can do with it and it looks good great product and fast shipping thank you its fun to imagine the household management options some info questions baffle alexa but other options are cool   esp musicrelated   easy to set up and works like its supposed to love it very easy to set uplove that you can request just about anything on your mind and it works on giving you useful information great product more skills are needed i love it my smart buyi am loving it and all the great things alexa can do this thing is awesome i got it on prime day for a great deal i wish i had purchased i also bought the echo show version but the sound is not nearly as good as the echo plus the echo show came dented so i will be exchanging it i like the screen and many of the features so i will not be getting a refund it was still worth the price is great having a new friend coop product many uses including smart devices throughout the home easy setup with great sound i would rate this unit a   and a must have for the office and home l am looking add other devices locks and lights for my home better than expected wonderful still learning how to use had a heck of a time setting it up but is happened somehow its fantastic very happy with the purchase love it i like the list ability and the music i can play i do not like that i can not create a playlist without using the app and even then alexa will not play my songs i have to do it through my tablet or phone i also do not like that alex can not print again it has to be done through the app it is a great bundle of fun music games questions etc i luv it turns off my smart lights i purchase more smart light for my lamps in the living room and my room time using alexa and so far i love it it was a little hard to follow their instructions great product this was a replacement it was really easy to set up i had to reauthorize my smart items to work with the new hub but installation was easy and instructions were clear really cool device that does a ton of stuff fun games like jeopardy we used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges i ve been waiting for to purchase an echo plus and now i m enjoying learning what alexa can do with a new sonos one and an echo dot i have the makings of a really nice and wellintegrated smart home love it i have nt had it very long but so far our whole family is enjoying asking alexa questions although this is my echo device i am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentationinstructions as to the many functions of the device i purchased becausse of the sound quality but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities by accident there needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device or at least point out where it can be found the echoplus is a great extension for the echo dots in our home i am a little disappointed that alexa is not as good at information requests as google but as a start on home automation she is very impressive i never had alexa before but the biggest reason i bought it was for youtube and apparently youtube stopped supporting it and that is why it will get stars its mostly youtubes fault but i worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist awesome loving alexa no habla espanol love the music the stories it is fantastic like it but it will take time to setup all the skills i want simply because there are so many i already use music and flash briefing very satisfied i use this along with alexa app on my kindle hd8 wish it would have came with the lightbulb but otherwise works great fast delivery and i enjoy using it still have nt learn all the echo can do but so far quite pleased love it i can receive my cpr classical station great soundwhat i like least is the learning curve and my mistakes sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it does nt respond or you forget the correct command alexa turn on the living room lights oops i mean alexa turn on the family room lights i also never realized i call my couch a sofa some times unfortunately my alexa is confused by my changing names for where i sit no it is broke and i ca nt get help fixing or replacing it i m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub so bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and i was looking forward to this feature being able to play music check the weather etc is fine sounds great have not used the hub yet is as expected and more responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the amazon app i also bought the philipshue light bulb and all i had to do was put it in my lamp and tell alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands sound is better it is as if we are having a conversation with another person instantaneous response and the fact that it catches your command even when you re far from it is simply just amazing although i have nt taken advantage of many of the echos features there is one that bothers me it starts talking even when i have nt said anything even close to the wake up word   echo   had to change from alexa due to a conflict with another device the echo plus is very straight forward and easy to use it plays great sounding music and can do lots of other things still learning what all it can do working very well so far we have used for we like it my children also like it alexa has become part of our family terrible stopped working after better sound than my echo dot simple to set up nice toy to have around it does not speak in spanishi bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when i m not love all the cool thing i can do great product like it still working discovery really too soon to fully evaluate but looking forward to learning and using it when i got this echo i was excited to have a device with better sound than my dot and a hub to control some hue bulbswhat i did nt realize and also was nt fully communicated to me is that you ca nt use hue bulbs to their full potential with this device you can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors you also can not update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for medo not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new iot devices if you do you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointlessi still love the echo and have complaints about the alexa functionality or sound quality of this device i m only disappointed with the hubs functionalities still needs some work on commands sound is equal in the regular echo so if you do nt need a smart hub get a regular echo the sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but i mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear i love my echo plus i use it with my spotify account to find my phone make phone calls turn our lights off and on much more most importantly it reads story to my children they love it and that makes me happy excellent why did nt i think it is in the beginning i love it bye bye philips hub and expensive internet charge took a little tinkering had to rest the individual bulbs but works great no more philips hue bridge is not responding message works great exactly as described only complaint i have is sometimes alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff i love it use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from very easy to hook up download the app and it walks you through the setup i am so disappointed in this product i tried to install different units and neither one of them were successfully completed with amazon technicians resetting each of them the app did nt connect the echo plus to the internet connection tried using the application on a phone a tablet and on a chromebook no luck there are no clean directions on the application probably sending this back to amazonmark this as not ready for prime time well behaved device that i enjoy using easy setup and sound quality i really love the hub feature what a blast we love echo just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too love this great sound quality works well with smart home devices use way more often than we used our google home mic hears everything but only understands the time it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result nice add on to a homewhat i do nt like are the limitations for example world soccer it wo nt give you much info of sport teams other than i was a little apprehensive about buying this because i saw reviews saying it sounds like crap i m no audiophile by any means so maybe its that but i think it sounds great considering the size it fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear i have nt had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands i have it paired to an my and a phillips hue light bulb i plan on adding devices as i go i love this thing and i m glad i scooped it up i have only had it will update if i run into issues i love my echo plus the only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient to use outdoors great device my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me the alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work i was not aware of that disappointed the echo plus is great so easy to set up and with the built in hub it connects to other alexa devices with a mere verbal command i am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me have my lights integrated with alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks definitely recommend the echo plus works as advertised it says alexa is always learning that s great because i am just learning all the things alexa can do great   love it wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item does nt seem to hear as well as my generation echo and why is there no volume buttons on it a worked great the built in hub works great it knows everything we ask it to do have nt smart hubbed it yet but does exactly as advertised and am very happy with our purchase sound quality is excellent also connecting and sound are perfect i only give 4 because the is no internal battery if i disconnect to the power source it will be off it seems easy to stump alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer we admit that we have not explored all that s available through the echo one irritating issue is that alexa can not answer help questions concerning how to use the system rather it refers you to the alexa app or help via a computer it was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful i like how easy it was to set up very easy to use and set up with other bluetooth devices ease of use and many tasks it will perform i purchased the echo plus with hub during sale it was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my wifi also connected it to a smart plug to control a light i love telling alexa to play music and she hears me from rooms away excited to learn new uses for it it was harder to setup then i thought it should be for some reason i had to default it twice had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices would be nice if it could interact with my xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras be nice set and disarm the alarm with alexa had to install a skill app to setup bulb   what s that about you ship it with your product   should have said alexa setup bulb or alexa find new bulb   and alexa setup nest its fine that you use party apps but alexa should do the work for you nothing to dislike i love my new toy that has made my house a smart home the built in hub lacks some of the features geo fencing of the phillips hub otherwise would have given it stars the echo plus is used for leisure and pleasure i absolutely love it easy to set up and connect what a great addition to my listening pleasure i have not used it yet for other purposes arrived right on time and works as expected its like a remedial form of the star trek computer in your home the echo part works fine the hue hub is a disaster it worked for and then nothing i spent on the phone with tech support one y to have to send it in for repair i am now trying to reconnect my lights what a pain i am having to reset each light bulb it can take up to times to get it to reset i have spent on this i will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps i love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too great for family game it was supposed to come with a free hue lightbulb on amazon prime day no light bulb arrived false advertising    awesome have nt had it and already it can not connect to my network tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect it will be on its way back to amazon this is the unit i purchased all the way from gen to the plus the only reason i purchased this is because it works so well and i wanted it in other rooms as well all my switches work great and i have had not issues i the past i did have some ghost commands when alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but i think some recent ipdates may have resolved this it just keeps improving over time not with call capabilities i work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest best way so far ca nt wait to see what they come up with next love it i play music everyday and voice activated makes it so easy i ca nt get multiple profiles working it just spins when adding a 2nd user at pass device prompt i love it   using music and turning on and off light it has great sound and very responsive to commands this thing is great has good sound and does everything i expected i have it linked in with my lights and use it with alarmcom as well no problems whatsoever makes life easy and sounds great this is a very useful device i use it to turn my lights on and off around the house it works with all the other alexa devices so i can give a command near any of them and this will process the request it also handles all the functions that the other devices can do i enjoy it much more than i thought i would i love my echo plus how can you not like the echo plus it has the built in hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices amazon makes a great product and i have nt had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices echo dots etc i have been hesitant to purchase anything smart home because i am just not good with electronics however this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the bluetooth in my sound bar for my tv which provides extra sound for music i can make calls and finally hear people when home i do not have cable only the paid apps like netflix and hulu so when alexa provided me news stations weather and other updates it was really great to hear i have linked all of my accounts to her she turns on my lights before i walk through the door she purchases reorders off of amazon for my pets and i heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to regardless if she was unplugged or not this is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone my tech savvy bf went out and bought her after of me having her must buy i love my echo plus and have cousins from here visiting and they love it i want to give them each one however will it work for them in someone please answer my question asap totally enjoy our new echo plus great for fast facts and listening to beautiful music we are just getting started with all the benefits device is touted as able to link to calendar on my samsung phone through google ca nt get it to work love this product music news shopping list jokes games works well need to speak clearly but picks up commands from a good distance and the sound is surprisingly well ill be returning it its been nothing but annoying the hub ca nt be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my hue bridge i ca nt even install philips lights with it unless i unplug it to do so there are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues bottom line is it sucks as a hub it does nt support zwave and zigbee which in fairness i knew in advance but when the one protocol it does support does nt do many functions that a dedicated one will what s the point i noticed right away that my philips hue bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this does nt i found that rather interesting    the echo does not link to direct tv even though they said it would i have spent on this made phone calls and texts also is missing free bulb still learning what it can do amazing simple works right out of a box only frustration is getting amazon alexa app t show up on my samsunggalaxy with googles android well what can you say love it love it love it enough said does nt use apple music it is worthless to me without it sound quality on it is also poor great product easy to install and use not a necessity but a commodity    works great i bought this direct from amazon and i have got to tell you this item echo show and echo plus is the best item i have ever had and i am kind of a tech geek i am a disabled person and it helps me turn light on and off and schedule doctor appointments using google voice phone and get my medical rides to and from hospitals plays music on cue from multiple web apps and watch videos as well as communicating to my nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events i wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights they are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off thank god no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights thank you amazon i will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from affirmcom to purchase more of each and some lights for rest of the jeff bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability i was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event really helped when all you earn a month is on ssdi thank you all again i m sure the echo is as cool as everyone saysbut i wo nt get to try this one even though i have a large covered porchthe package was left on my top step on a day forecast for chance of rainand rain it did soaking the package i m not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is this order has been cursed from the beginning ordered as a birthday gift and delivery was not made on scheduled day now i get it and its rainsoaked so far i love it it was easy to set up   if i can do it anybody can speakers are great and its fun to play my music with just a voice command i am not tec smart enough to make it work at all will send it back if i ca nt get help my eco dot works just fine this is too complacatedi just wanted a bigger speaker we are a long time amazon prime family but new to the alexa world and thought the purchase of alexa plus with hub and included phillips hue light bulb would be a great start alexa does a lot of good things for us like alarm in the verbalize books playing music on command even linked to my sirriusxm account good stuff good sound but not bose but the ads say hub included so do nt need anything else to operate devices well not so i understand there will be some differences in product device support the fact that it came with the hue light bulb works only for on off dimming of the bulb the bulb is capable of so much more with the hue app but the hue app does not recognize alexa hub as a bridge so it appears you do have to get a philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes time the lights when you are away set color tones etc that can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home the list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge was very disappointed to find that out after the fact to the point i feel we are being misled by amazon by included the hue bulbs without explanation maybe throw a good discount my way to get the hue bridge if i keep the echo plus before i invest in more light bulbs    i love it but does not play well with my amazon prime many shortcomings and potential fees item as described and delivered on time thank you i bought 2 of these plus echo generation on prime days love the echo plus easy to setup the reason for the star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free philips hue white a19 single led bulb works with amazon alexa there is no one to call to find out why product does not light bar never went orange i googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions i tried both product is defective exactly what i wanted with speedy shippingthank you so much easy to install i have an original echo and really like it i wanted another one for my basement i realize it is nt a huge stereo with settings but it does nt sound bad at all definitely does nt take up much room great price for the echo plus on prime day i ordered i bought this on prime day and saved lotsi have large blue tooth speakers in my house that i used for the echo plus was louder than all combined at the same time very impressed with the clarity and volumeyou will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio that s just a sad fact it ll play pandora and spotify but its limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptiondoes not stream youtube music or youtube audioapple users will be disappointed to see that its not as convenient as an apple deviceoverall i still loved the device but ill be getting the dot which has an audio out jack as does the echo plus and just connect to external speakers i have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a philip hue bulb the excited ended quickly i spend about a total of attempting to add this bulb to my alexa echo plus everything i tried ended in a discovery failed message i tried to set this up over and over and over again i watched youtube videos i read set up websites i was the poster child of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different resultsthe next day i went onto amazon to get the tech support i was hoping something would be done to make this thing work but also the problem not being operator error well after tech support staff and 1 hr and 19 mins of being on the phone it still did nt work this product has tested my patience so far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old schoolthe only reason i gave this two stars is because amazon will be sending me a different echo plus and light bulb the problem was nt the bulb because before packing up the items i purchased another bulb and still alexa could nt locate this devicei pray the next attempt is successful and then i will revise this rating but what are the odds that i was shipped a defective echo the support person had the same thought maybe i should be exploring the google device but i ca nt get over the look of that hub it looks like a defuseri ca nt believe i did nt find youtube videos that show the problems i did everything looked simple and seamlessnot the experience i had ok i m done with this review because i spend enough wasted time already got this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event it sounds pretty good and works well so far very nice and its does not take up space i m an original purchaser of the echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and i ve always loved it i expanded my alexa usage by adding a few echo dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an echo plus let me tell you what great choice as much as i love my original echo the plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable the sound is great and the fact that its got a built in hub for the philips hue lights is a huge plus received the wrong productwas so excited to install it all excitement gone thank you amazon i m having trouble with it the alarm most of times does nt work the timer does nt ends and alexa keeps saying she is unavailable love it just wish i could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated zigbee hub the hub is compatible with the link bulbs i got it to try side by side with the echo originale they are essentially the same in dimension weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub as many folks already pointed out the hub is not a direct replacement for the philips hue z wave or anything else it provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub for me the voice recognition and music play capability is the same the original echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i do nt really need the hub with less functionality in addition i do nt think that amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed my philips hub gets software update probably once and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs fw and they fixes bugs net net for me this echo does not do anything more than the original echo and sound quality is not as good with the original echo available as refurbished i would check that out before considering this or the new echo which is clearly inferior to both of these why do we need to buy a hub to get it to work with and many other devices i want my money back this thing wo nt even turn on my tv unless i buy another hub what s the point of having a hub that does nt support half the devices out there do nt buy this thing unless you want to spend on another hub it wo nt work with many of your devices just by the echo or dot if you must but not this better yet get a google device they actually understand you when you talk i love it in my living room absolutely love it only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable when playing music with bluetooth speaker outside i have to go inside to change songs i only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb when i got everything set up i realized the echo plus hub wo nt allow full functionality of the bulb all it does is turn the light onoff and dim it will not change colors you still have to have a hue bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb i wish i d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo i already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and ill have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights at a volume setting of or less the speaker sounds like there is something rattling crackling or vibrating in it i d understand if the volume was set higher all speakers get distorted when overdriven but this does nt sound like this is an overdriven case sounds like more of a rattlecrackle possibly because the bass is too high learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics other than volume i will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem the sound is fantastic for the classic music is like you have the orchestra at your home and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top but also you can tell alexa volume love alexa makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time i was suppose to get the free lightbulb with purchase it did not come with echo upon reading more carefully it says to click a box to receive free bulb   of course i want the free bulb who would nt just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many   free bulbs away disappointed i have yet to set up my echo our purchase on any alexia device debating if we want to keep it it did come quickly with my prime membership i bought this for myself and i did nt realize it had to be plugged in just to work it is nt convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall it should ve been more clear when i bought it    alexa helps with more than just lights or music it helps out when your kids think they know everything and you know nothing lol sweet love it so much so i purchased alexa has been a great purchase for my uncle whom lives by himself when i got it he was nt so keen on it but now its his best friend he tells her goodmorning and she will say it back along with a description on something that is happening or something special that happened on as well as sang him happy birthday lolol he now has educated him self on things he never knew and laughs at the things she may say when he waits to see he response to something he s asked love it and to think i was going to hate it incredible piece of technologyi have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter the mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good i connected the echo via bluetooth to my sony soundbar on my tv but find the echo placement and 360 sound more appealing its no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass the sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building the knob on the top works great for adjusting volume this is my echo device and i would imagine having to press volume buttons on the echo a large inconvenience and not as precise for that alone i would recommend this over the regular echo 2nd generationthe piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it the rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it overthis order came with a free philips hue bulb which i installed along with an extra one i bought i put the bulbs into my living room floor lamp turned on the light and all i had to do was say alexa connect my devices the default names for each bulb was assigned as light and light so i can have a dimmer floor lamp if i just turned onoff one of the lights by saying alexa turn off the light in the alexa app i created a group with light and light and named the group the light so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining i just say alexa turn on the lighti was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the echo plus with its built in hub i thought i would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb i was surprised by that awesomeyou will feel like tony stark on this device i added quite a few skills like thunderstorm sounds and quote of the   alexa always loads them up quickly adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on amazon music is also a great featurei can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownershipi was lucky to buy this for on prime day but i think for 150 is it pretty expensive considering the echo is in my opinion you will be paying a premium for the echo plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you1 taller and 360 sound volume knob on top that you spin i think this is a huge benefit over built in hub for hue bulbs after researching more there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups for me and my floor lamp its just perfecti highly recommend it and will buy an echo dot for my bedroom now easy to install very clear speaker i took star off because it was delivered late by ontraclike usual love love love    good product i would like to tell you that i have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck or the color or the shape or even the way it smells but i can honestly say the number reason i hate this device is i have tried to set it up now to no avail i have other echo devices already that i set up and use quite regularly i have reset my phone galaxy s8 checked the app for updates i have cycled power to the echo unit with each attempt i work in the networktechnology industry for a living and have for now so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here i used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up the set up screen just continues to roll the dots around the screen for before the app locks up on my phone and i have to force the app to close restart my phone and the echo and try again i figured was enough it should nt be that hard a techie i can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technologyi hope they wo nt call me ill tell em to send the product back pretty cool device still have a lot to learn but i m changing channels on my fios and getting info needed the speaker is great for what i needed it for which mainly is music unit came with the wrong plug will have to send back to amazon love it the sound quality is really quite good i also have a dot which is bluetooth linked to a grace digital amplifier which is driving a couple of floor standing snell speakers obvious the floor standing speakers are better than this but not by much my only complaint is that you ca nt customize alexa hot words now that i have multiple alexa devices there needs to be a way to direct an alexa command to a particular device i would like to be able to talk to a device by name love the light bulb feature the echo plus works as expected but i never received the philips hue smart bulb that was supposed to be included as part of my purchase please advise very nice everything is working fine just have to learn the commands the sound quality is great it now replace the echo dot in my kitchen just got mine played around with it for a while should have bought it a long time ago so easy to use nonstop music    great product and prime day price took a while to figure out how to connect to my wireless network and the other echo devices in my home this came with a philips smart bulb its better than having a clapper i found instructions online to wake to music   philips light very easy to set it up with the instructions you even have an option of what song you want to wake up to exchange new color alexa is the best smart speaker out there i m so glad i came across it the sound is so amazing and i mostly use amazon alexa for music and school work help i love to control my room lights and the color totally recommend it get on sale after so   check events before u buy these amazon products    pros plenty loud for a large room with high ceilingscons   the hub does nt do anything it does nt work with z wave as it states it does nt take voice commands for smartthings which i had to buy since the hub does nt work for z waveit also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the eq not sure if that is on all models but the dots we have are clearfor the money buy an echo dot or echo generation the echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub go figure and the audio is clear the dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper alexa is a decent speaker if that s all you need she is terrible at most other things she consistently answers questions that were not asked or says hmmm i do nt know that for everything else we ve gone back to just using our phones because she ca nt really look anything up pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when i had an awesome bose bluetooth already i bought her because my mother who lives alone uses hers a lot and is happy with it but we have a full house with kids and i m less than impressed i d never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall the setup of this device was simple and effective i am very pleased to see all of the additional skills and add on abilities of alexa this is great for my mobility issues i now have the ability to have my shopping and comfort needs met without depending on friends and family perfect we love it bought the light bulbs as well and we use it daily alexa is great only she will laugh or add random comments in conversations i was asking a sibling why they are using alexa upstairs versus the one downstairs then the echo dot downstairs starting singing oh technology oh technology kind of weird but it seems to have a mind of its own love love love my amazon echo plus the sound quality is not that good especially for the price that you pay for this i would recommend to get the echo dot and buy a better speaker instead maybe sonos and use the echo dot alexa was able to call my phone when i could nt find it and also turned on and off the light when commanded then i came home and it would nt turn on the light but would shut it off then she said i had no devices could nt find my phone now working again we will see love the selection of music i will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible with my lifetime amazon spending approaching i m sure i m just a small customer to them but i ve rarely been so disappointed out of if not of amazon purchasesi have echos for home automation and bought this echo plus specifically for the builtin hub along with in zigbee light switches the voice control is subpar even when it works and that is a rarity most often it does nothing i could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the amazonzigbee ecosystem if you value your money and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere    i love alexa she works great but she not for little children she does nt understand if you do nt speak clearly she fun to have holy sound quality batman this thing jams its insanely helpful and just a nice gadget to have around very easy to set up and use slowly adding devices to truly make our house a smart home both alexa and i are learning what we can do with each new item i am happier that i made the purchase so far my only regret is i did nt do it sooner get this in white i bought it for my girlfriend in white and i wish i had it in white now alexa is one of those devices you will always use and miss when its not around i find new uses for alexa every day i ve incorporated this device into so many parts of my daily life as alexa learns more i learn more she s my alarm clock she reminds me of important dates i m constantly asking her for information like travel entertainment science history politics etc she turns on and off lights she s the core of my smart home i love it best gift i got myself i love the sound very good we use it for home automation also works well i really have nt found any difference between this and the original version i bought they both work great personal we are really enjoying the echo plus it is fun too love echo everywhere i go in my house she s always reminding me playing music or talking to me love her very good quality and you do nt have to yell or be close for it to work and understand you properly so convenient   i will never touch the remote again to shut off my tv we love everything easy setup very fun to use connects with all my smart home appliances expensive but it is a slightly better sound than my original echo the sound of the speaker is better than the other echo i own i m loving my easy access to all the music and books i listen to from amazon music and audible the treble mid and bass sound wellequalized i love that i can easily take it to any area of my house and plug it in its nice and light weight with a good length of cord this is our alexa we love it so far using it for lights and music will connect my tv vacuum and doorbell soon love it enjoying it so much i like that its voice activated but it do nt link with any other bluetooth devices only alexa devices it appears to be working fine my echo stopped replying to my requests and i received the echo plus very happy no problems no hassel exchange this is the best amazon speaker with alexa in it but if you re thinking its a good smart hub you re wrong are you can do is connect your smart lights and devices to it and tell alexa to turn them on and off that s it you re better off buying separate hubs so you have more control of your devices still trying to link to my sons and daughters in their rooms    did nt really work as smooth as they make it seem like it does everything that it offers love besides being fun it also has many practical aspectsa real bonus for those with vision issues works perfect alexa us funny and enjoyable nice sound echo plus with hub   black amazon good product i like it   thank you   its louder than the dot and its got a built in hub for all the other wireless controls in the house easy set up was debating between a 4 and a star review the challenge with the hub is that phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub basic functionality works with this unit but now i need apps to set everything how i want it instead of one which has caused some user issues its woken up a couple times without the trigger word which i find highly unsettling we have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly but its usually just or repeats if that happensthe speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchenliving room the sleek design is not obtrusive my girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we ve had entertaining conversations with it works great very happy love this device i really like this item i already had the echo dot but with this purchase the philips hue bulb came with the plus just purchasing the plus i have not had time to use it to its full capabilities but the bulb is something else i use that with the echo dot to turn on our bedroom light and i really like it the plus is in our great roomkitchen area so far i give this a star love it convenient responsive learns voices within the household best assistant so far i am the training coordinator at my company and i have used the amazon blueprints skill with an echo device and echo buttons to create my own gameshowquiz for new hire orientation training i m always looking for new ways to engage trainees in order to make learning more enjoyable i believe that if someone enjoys the process of learning then they re much more likely to remember the information so far this has been a huge success with my classes and i look forward to amazon improving and building out the blueprints skill further this is a great tool toy roomfilling music very convenient to use just fun to have why only 4 stars supposed to work with logitech harmony remote nope supposed to work with denon receivers nope this may not be amazont fault but advertised skills should actually work we also have the echo show and the ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door amazing product with amazing sound i love the echo plus mainly because i do nt have to worry about putting a cd in to play i just command a song and it plays however i was disappointed to learn later that it needed to stay plugged in unlike the echo after consulting with amazon and learning that i can purchase a portable echo charging station i m goodsincerely we love this as an echo its great good sound quality and functionality as a smart home hub it sucks no automation no geofencing no music syncing for hue no zwave all it does is turn things on with your voice ended up buying a smartthing hub and transferring everything over we have a great time using this as a family even my toddler can talk to her   there are a few features i wish it would learn to do but overall we love it and glad we brought it over the google home   great got with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updatesits far from being usefulhalf the time when you wake the device to ask a question or initiate a command it does nt hear what you say and turns off basically ignoring you often she is unable to answer basic questionsits been so frustrating alexa has been more work rather than making my life easieri would return it but i m past the return period zzzz it is very convenient but wish i could request more music ideal when you have amazon prime my very first fire tv stick i should have purchased a long time ago i wish i bought or on amazon prime day and not to forget the fantastic alexa features we love it finally got one for everyone in the home most importantly were saving money that would have otherwise gone to cable i love my firestick i do nt know why i held out on getting this for so long    cord cutting works great bought as a gift for my boyfriend easy   fun to use    it works great using it to stream amazon prime and netflix i put it on a tv that did nt have a great picture and it now looks like a new tv works as expected it is much more difficult to use than the chromecast fast to load but keeps rebooting in middle of shows great works great and its so easy to use that my can navigate it i live this item i bought several for each room in the house and as a gift for my mom i also use mine to travel with i love how i can just push the microphone button on the remote and ask it to open any show and it ll find whether its on hulu or netflix and sign me in and start the show pretty amazing but each new technology sure is making me lazy or lol   a great product i would buy another the power cord attachment tends to come loose from the outlet the adapter may be too long and heavy not a big problem but annoying when the unit is plugged in it works great loved it wish i would have bought one sooner able to watch all of the shows i love and more totally clear picture with numerous channels available used for my kitchen tv very easy to use easy to use love the fire stick i can download watch great movies instead of searching i use alexa voice prime does nt offer very many newer movies is the only negativei also wished there was a way you could set it up to post newest movies very easy to install voice control is great love it great buy at 20 i am guilty of not setting this up i had my youngest daughter do it she did not seem to have much trouble figuring it out so i would have to assume it was not very difficult i have not tried to use it yet but my oldest seems to like it so she ordered one for herself problem you need to buy an app from amazon to mirroring your iphone   app price   other than that the device is perfect    streaming is easy i love it because i can watch netflix in my bedroom on my tv and not my ipad absolutely love it great product we listen to music all the time ummm tv like everyone else we love the fire tv stick and will love it even more when we sever our cable connection when our service agreement expires love the tvmovie selection i really like the fact that i can just rent a movie if they do nt have it in their selection so far no major issues i love it super easy to use hole the button and speaktakes you right to it without delay   love itso happy to have everything available through this    best streaming device i ve used in just wish the remote had a headphone jack like the roku remote does exceeded my expectations new device so still learning about it but works great for us when navigating hulu its ok my home screen on my fire stick is not working on my television so by that not workingalexa will not respond to any questions or commandsim going to reach out to amazon so awesome to bring my older tv to life this makes a big difference in searching for programs so much easier then the older fire stick faster to great and easy to use i used to use my laptop for anything show watching including netflix but i am glad i bought this this is super easy to set up and has everything you need with quick and easy access definitely worth the buy i just think that its to darn confusing and there are parts that i would try and just would nt work i just do nt like it not what i thought it would be easy to set up and use i will never buy anything amazon makes againthis fire stick is not even a year old and it does nothing but restart and freeze up constantly no warranty from amazon in this should have been my clue that it was a horrible device i will never buy anything built by amazon again great buy recommend getting kodi with some movie addons the firestick is easy to use and was super easy to set up i like the platform and feel it is better than i expected i was worried about it lagging but it has not at all i m hoping to utilize the firestick to eventually break away from cable and now i m more confident that it can happen works much easier than our 3 year old better internet resemption works amazing i love how you can download almost anything some apps i could nt download on my apple tv but i was able too on here the fire tv stick was easy to set up and use only downfall is subscriptions are needed to view premium content prime video love it its everything i wanted and more i like the way you can watch anything and everything   for some live shows you need a cable provider es excelente funciona genial was loving it but starting in hulu stopped working and crunchyroll does nt work either probably will switch to something else soon puts the pep back in my old tv all of the software was expired and i enjoy netflix and amazon prime video now i have all of my favorite video on the tv again have nt used it enough the fire stick has been amazing easy setup and easy to use an awesome deal on love the fire stick and the amazon customer service easy to use and setup great streaming device works as expected very easy to setup and use awesome product the selection is wonderful and the ease of use on the home page is nice i wish however it did nt keep overcoming my settings for my other devices attached to my tv i have to keep switching back after any switches in programming including my stereo bought the firestick for bedroom easily installed and set up works great great interface i enjoy the voice remote i liked it was linked to prime it good i love it i already bought one previously to try out and enjoyed it bought these new ones during the prime sale works like a charm fast delivery and no problems ok i loved it so much on my living room tv that i bought one for the bedroom tv highly recommend this device to anyone wanting to simplify and improve their online entertainment experience does everything i need love it love it love it awesome device can watch amazon prime shows and talk to alexus this product replaces the generation fire stick i had and what an improvement in speed in both showing amazon content but all apps downloaded on product i bought in on for   best deal ever   just as advertised bought as a gift great price fast shipping    very easy to set up and straight forward directions loads fast also i purchased the fire stick to be able to watch movies at my convenience i love that there is such a variety of genres i also enjoy it gives you the ability to watch tv shows too its awesome being able to tell it what to go to love this so many options i love it love it many stations to choose from it was a gift it still does nt work i bet if i call and let them know that they will charge me for the time ridiculous i love the alexa remote and easy to use    works great it is very easy to usei can now watch my favorite movies doubtful at but it works a lot better than my smart devicesplus alexa software include that was a plus love our fire stickeasy to set up and have loads of shows for free and plenty to rent or buywe also use pluto tv and tubi so that s even more tvalexa makes it so easy to find any show or movie i love the money we save it was perfect works like a charm netflix and hulu i love this fire stick because after installing a few highly recommended apps i discovered that a lot of the channels i do nt have with my cable provider is included and i do nt have to pay extra just subscribing to a few streaming apps will do and i still come out paying way less than cable tv love this wished i had gotten it sooner makes accessing all of the apps easy love the voice control its my one and works well i love my fire stick great product very versatile and easy to use ease of usage i love this its quick and easy to use i love that there are so many apps you can access but disappointed some of them cost extra money to use i also love the music app on here i did nt think i would use it because i have alexa echo and listen to music all the time on there but i tried it on the fire tv and it gives you the lyric as the songs play love it love it the only downside is that you ca nt download any app you want still learning how to use it but like it so far we played music from youtube and a couple movies on it no complaints we are using the internet for our home and loving them my father liked the added programing in which he is interested i love my fire stick love it and how easy it is to use one of purchases we have made satisfied with the purchase i m able to connect to prime quick absolutely love this product so easy to use better than scrolling channels    loved it no more cable bills for us i would advise anyone to get 2nd one bought i bought it for my sister and she has nt had any complaints yet so i think its great absolutely an amazing device very easy to setup and use the current demand for this stick was too high for the power coming out of my usb port on the tv had to run the power cable to the supplied usb adapter not a big deal but added another cable showing on my wall mounted tv works very well for amazon and netflix but will not a let all viewing platforms like vudu it also will shut down if hulu is played for more than a couple minutes and yes i have it directly plugged into the wall so low power source is not an issue even checked outlet voltage an issue which is typically the answer you get for that issueover all the quality of the picture is quiet well and is a user friendly platform to use if they would fix those issues i would have one on every tv in the house but as it sits this will be our only one to bad to because i relay like amazon products and having alexa is always nice love the firestick thinking about canceling the satellite i m amazed at how many movies tv shows and more is available i am planning to drop cable service soon and am very happy to know ill have lots of viewing pleasure with the fire stick and not pay the outrageous cable bills easy to setup sometimes alexis does not work the greatest the connection fire stick and is way bettter than netflix   works great ease of use finally bought one but it could nt find my wifi had to buy a wifi extended my smart tv used the wifi just fine this firestick is everything recently cut the cord on cable television needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap ordered the amazon fire stick from best buy instructions were short and easy to follow i was going to order the amazon ethernet adapter because i was worried about wireless speeds in my area but thought i d wait and see glad i did wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far a few brief hiccups here and there but i m convinced that was from the apps themselves do nt miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what i used to watch for a much lower price which right now is a total of amazon fire stick is limited to of memory and 8 gb of storage thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading apps and recording shows so far it has nt been any issue at all the upcoming fall tv schedule which includes the return of nfl football might prove more troublesome when i need to record more often ill worry about that then my only real issue is that you ca nt really turn it off the screen remains on and uses up electricity although probably small amounts luckily when you unplug it all downloaded apps and recorded shows stay in memory not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when its unplugged have nt tried it yet although i do nt think it ll be an issue with directtv now which i m using right now so far i m loving the amazon fire actually love that amazon which i use occasionally come preinstalled everything love this really enjoying my firestick ca nt wait to get rid of cable such a waste of money good love it easy to set up and use woohoo on prime day done perfect very easy to use makes finding shows and movies a snap    upgraded from a generation firestick i do nt know why i waited so long i love it amazing device great product this was a replacement of an older version of fire stick i have nt tried the alexa voice part of this remote yet but it works great i bought and love them alexa is very convenient like i do nt have alexa but after getting this i m feeling inspired to get one i feel this is a good gateway and or alexa trial and liking it so far channels work just fine like apple tv just need to check if there is a phone app for a keyboard typing because spelling things out on keyboard sucks for searching youtube clips i definitely like this product wanted to be able to watch netflix on my tv easy to install   great product so many features i like to watch older shows 70s and 80s and the firestick gives me the opportunity to find those shows i really like this product and the fact that i can get apps that i am unable to get on my smart tv works wonderfully use it all the time and love it very quality product i have used roku   mi tv box this fire tv stick is very similar easy to use we all just love the tv fire stick and i would buy it again is good works really well worked as advertised   it works great better than the previous fire stick very easy setup and alexa can be heard well and receive very well i like my amazon fire stick i use it for my tv thank you for your help when i called you to get further instructions how to use it thank you have a good great   it was the best decision   especially if you have amazon prime i love everything about the fire stick its easy to use and alexa makes it quicker to get to tv shows or music works great alexa finds all the goodies you could ask for i was able to use this in another room and add alexa in that room works great speed is fast exactly what we needed this was just an additional one for my other tv loved it so much use it on the regular tv easy to set up and fairly easy to navigate i do nt waste my money on regular tv cable or anything else this is enough for me as i do nt watch too much tv i love this its user friendly and better than any streaming device we have previously used i wish we had purchased sooner and purchased more of them my mom loves that she can watch of blue bloods   my one wish is that she could watch csimiamiwithout having to pay for it the bill for optimum is already quite high can you help us we live on long island ny suffolk county   excellent i absolutely love it its just what l needed and more i did nt realize that the remote included voice remote how convenient i m so glad that l made that purchase its better than i thought it practically turns your regular tv into a smart tv lovee it it has evrything i need it now i ca nt even get my dad out of my room movie addicts works great to watch youtube and amazin video like it alots something different than traditional television the use of alexa is nice too works well i have several of these recommend to anyone awesome wish i had gotten one sooner great product works great no lag and is much better than the gen devices i was using i would recommend this if you have a 1rst gen and are tired of the lag and crashes works great easy set up love it so easy to use i love the firestick   its easy to set up and use it rarely stops to buffer and it would be a bargain at twice the price i do like the fire stick and i m very close to cutting the cable i can find many movies and shows while keeping my budget in check i m learning how to maneuver around the channels and find my shows quickly simple install and love the voice activation we have nt used it much yet we like what we have used my husband loves it very easy to set up and very easy to use once connected it brought so many options to view we connected with quite a few of the channelsmust have great product had a bit of a problem to download kodi but once it is done you get all the movies tv programs very impressed simple to use perfect for streaming our shows ditched cable and we are in love best streaming device on the market i now own 3 great product love the larger remote great deal this thing is awesome we watch it more then the regular cable going to by more on black as gifts love all the options with the fire tv stickworks great the menus are cumbersome to get your apps set up easy to use awesome good shape i m very unhappy with this firestick every time we change programs or channels within a program there is a very long delay we have 2 rokus that work just fine and are very quick had to return it as hulu does not work on device it kept coming up with errors and hulu app not being able to open at times it was hit and miss and at times hulu will stop working right in the middle of a show or movie plus fire stick is very slow in opening the apps i love my amazon sticks i like being able to watch pretty much anything i want at anytime works great i love my fire stick it is so easy to use the firestick we were sent does nt work at all voice remote wo nt even turn on we did all the troubleshooting steps did nt work contacted amazon they sent us a new   with no remoteno way to control it we gave up and got a roku which works great just the perfect cost effective solution thank you amazon to use and i enjoyed it i do wish the dot could connect to the fire stick but both products still worked flawlessly my old amazon fire stick kept crashing when using sling tvi bought this one thinking the old one was defectivethis one is doing the same thing when going back into sling it starts up where i left off in the program ordered on deal day 1 does nt work and just went down after   love my fire stick and remote so easy to set up and use endless amounts of apps to download used it with my smart tv and its 100x better than the features smart tvs offer great easy to set upa little difficult to navigate and the instructions are non existent super good fun taking to the tv works good its a little confusing moving around the programs that it does nt turn my television on or off i loved how easy this was to install sry up and use simply amazing so amazing we bought twothis allowed us to officially cut the cable cordlove it i expected to have access to more current movie instead of having to pay the easy setup was helpful and i love the speedy delivery works great i recommend it to anyone who has prime wifi and an hdm1 tv that s all u need i m not really technologically savvy but even i was able to set it up with included and on screen directions need a few more i love that you can watch bob dylans movies love the alexa feature firestick is working just fine very easy to install very intuitive to use very happy with the purchase ease of use i do nt like how i can not load my hulu account it is also very slow i know it is not my internet connection because i have an xbox one that works just fine but my fire tv stick takes forever to load anything amazing for all your entertainment needs its constantly buffering to the point where you ca nt watch anything without interruption i purchased on prime day plus i used rewards to pay for it so in the end i paid next to nothing if i had paid full price for it i might want my money back we stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device i know our internet service is not the issue because we do not have this problem with any other devices that we stream from i did nt realize it needed an external power source in order to utilize the fire stick i thought it was more along the lines of a flash drive device you singley plugged into your tv however since using my amazon fire stick i have enjoyed every moment of it and would definitely recommend this product to any and all i love it easy to install and operate works with alexa voice commands this was a prime day purchase i m still learning my way around it so far so good the addition of alexa is nice i love how it is alexa enabled i just say the show i want to watch and she knows how and where to find it for me super easy to set up easy to use lots of app options available the stick is a solid entry level device and does what its supposed to do works fine i wanted this for my bedroom television does not work with you tube tv easy to set up easy to use i love all the viewing choices on fire stick good product this is my 2nd fire tv stick with alexa i have been very happy with my one love that you can use so many apps with it big   love the firestick my kids love that they can talk to alexa and get the weather local news etc it offers of entertainment and it was very easy to install and activate   amazon fire stick is amazing   i have of them the one i have to reset it at least once a week or so some times twice awesome product more than expected i do nt like that it goes into sleep mode after of inactivity i should nt have to wake up the fire tv to finish watching a show availability of movies and nothing i do nt like very satisfied easy setup great product highly recommend we like it better than roku voice commands really work easy setup works flawlessly easy to hook up wish i knew all its capabilities great purchase easy to set up it was easy to use for our bedroom tv i used chromecast before this it was okay but i love does nt lag would recommend    i bought this fire stick for another tv no more arguments about what to watch i liked it until on day after a year it no longer worked would not power up and go past the firestick logo on tv bought a one will not buy a if this one does nt last longer we love our fire stick the alexa voice control is fantastic for my younger kids setup was easy and usage was intuitive i ve used it away from home and it works great i really love that all my apps are in one spot i love the number of movies that are available using this device took me a little time to setup and learn how to work it the only thing i miss is local channels love that the fire stick allows me enough choices to ditch cable plenty of options to choose from it worked as a charmed i love it   easy set up as well i love how fast you get a respond from alexaalso easy to find any thing you are looking forjust speak in to the remote extremely easy to use switched away from directv and use it to stream tv it do nt show nothing works like a charm works great some of the apps will start buffering but its probably my internet love the alexa voice control it does what it says it will do the picture quality is better than what i have been receiving on cable tv only downside is if you pause the movie for it takes a long time to come back on and you often get a message that your internet speed is too slow i m clocking mb at my house on a good day also voice command through alexia does nt work well but that could be operator error all in all for 20 you ca nt beat it i loved everything very disappointed when we had to mandatory upgrade and when we final got done with the upload we had lost our local charlotte nc channels which are pur news and weather also nbc and was amazon day with discounts on what we had just ordered one for my house this is greati am not tech oriented and all i have to do is hold down a button and talk now i am watching tv too much lol i love this thing the alexa feature makes it so easy to find what you want no matter which streaming service has it no more searching netflix then amazon etc to see if either has your show alexa finds it for you great product love it i feel that the voice feature is useless lots of channels to stream though garbageeven trying to watch amazon prime video this piece of garbage looses internet connection way thru a show the cheapest roku works time better do not waste your time or money on this piece of garbage loved it love the fire stick alexa works well on it too would recommend just getting started with the fire tv stick so far so good easy to set up lots of things to watch and program in have not even gotten that far into it yet easy to use highly recommended leaning more and more closer to cutting the cable cord for good was a gift this is my second firestick i a very pleased with the ease of use i would not recommend this to anyone it wo nt load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it wo nt run the program all the way thru it tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time try again later it is not the netflix site cause i can stream it just fine on my computer its the firestick very disappointing worth i like when thete nothing to watch on tv i can run to my firestick access to apps easy to install and use thank you great product purchased this for the man cave and loving it no tiene o no se pueden cambiar a espanol o titulos en espanol easy to install up and running in was excited to try this on my new element tv unfortunately even though my tv is away from my router i get maddening disconnections and buffering thought this little device was supposed to take care of that issue it did nt easy to use all your favorite programs all inclusive nothing else to buy fun to play with as of nowi love everything about it powerful little stick superb is all we can say plugged the unit in set up the hdmi and boom we were watching better tv thank you its like having your tv as a big tablet loved them i am very pleased with the fire stick works good ni issues great price great product fire stick is the best i think works better then roku love how i can take it on vacation and use it very easy to set up as a user of chromecast for i have to say that the firestick is a nice upgrade i really like that i can download all the apps for different media sources like showtime etc that i have free access to from my cable account but with the firestick i get a better picture and can go directly to the shows i want to see the downside was the time it took to download all the apps and set them up but the good thing is that the setup is a onetime procedure currently own chromecast devices and tge fire stick is superior to them we are so pleased that we can watch programs on netflix and prime without a smart phone or computer very easy to install and use menu does nt work says it ca nt connect to amazon network i would love this remote if i was nt spending so much money replacing the batteries its upsetting that i spent money on such a great device all for the batteries not to last this was purchased for our toy hauler but it came the day before we left for a trip by plane it was wonderful to plug into our hotel tv and watch our normal tv shows rather than whatever was showing at the time and sit through commercials already had a firestick in our livingroom great entertainment had to get one for the bedroom very good option purchased to use on the road in my semi does not work in that application great i love my fire stick thank you so much easy to setup i am enjoying the added video choices for my television the installation and connection to my wifi was so easy getting the amazon prime and netflix going was a breeze i have not used a voice remote before that was amazing yes i am old school i will be reviewing more features and options as i have time but i am very excited to own such a product that lives up to the all the great things i have read and heard i like this product however the set up was a bit difficult i had to reset it to the factory setting abd start from scratch i loved the i can use voice to make a request i use it for music and movies very easy to install and am excited to use so far so good works great great device i m cutting my cable and watching the channels i want if i want to add an app like i can just pay a little extra and get it everything about it is great love the alexa voice remote works like a charm    thought it was pretty cool new to streaming thing seemed easy to use supereasy setup only issue i find is that it occasionally loses connection with household network turned our old tv into a smart tv really easy interface have bought now easy set up works perfect this is an awesome product i wanted to test out the differences between this and my roku and both are very nice i will likely be using this for traveling as well   good wifi tv stick i love it seems to work ok but no youtube tv really ca nt believe they would ban an app that so many people want to use i really wanted to like it but when i could nt install that particular app it became almost useless almost does most other stuff just fine but ill stick with my roku this thing is great if you have internet and amazon prime awesome product easy set up nice looking interface and i like the new slightly larger remote i have a 1st gen with the little remote and misplace it all the time and great price great product and easy to use great gadget that installs and works easily nice to not have another box taking up space too excellent product and service very easy to install and my daughter is very happy great entertainment being able to use it with my alexa echo was great easy to use and fast setup love it i set her up to play through our home theater system so fat we are just using her for weather forecasts cooking timers and we really enjoy the music small device that my kids like to ask questions very handy friendly interactive beyond awesome i like that it responds every time it was easy to set up i m still learning what i can do with it i may like a better speaker more family loved it    i like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the google only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker easy to use echos are great i have a few of them through out our home   all in voice range to ask a question say a command to turn lights on or off or my favorite is play music all though the house love it   this time its a gift for friend fantastic product i use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program great i am quite disappointed by this productthere clearly is a bug of the time i ask for a newsflash two second after it starts the whole thing stops and reboots for same goes when i ask to play the radio also many times it get confused when i ask to switch of the lightsas other items are also named the same which is not true clearly no ai or natural language very beta stage still for me not impressed love this thing works great and kids love it to love it makes the simple things in life simpler i am really enjoying the many different features on my alexa especially listening to music and audio books echo dot is a wonderful invention we love it alexa is so smart alarm and music information the weather love it very helpful good but its pretty low alarm calendar reminders i have had the echo dot for and am having fun with it i set morning alarms check the weather have alexa play various music i bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound and i m learning her skills a little tricky to connect to wifi initially but after some trial and error it connected and has stayed connected so far super satisfied will be buying one for my mother and one for my office i am completely in love does absolutely everything and is so amazing and great nope still a lot to be improved for most of the things we ask it says hmmmm i do nt know that the speaker could be better i love it dot love it works like any other one love my new alexa she works great so far i bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and i was excited when it came in i set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine the set up was easy and straight forward which i really appreciated because i am terrible with technology the only reason why i am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that i ca nt use the echo dot for without it disconnecting from the internet i am connected to both and wifi links and neither works its very frustrating because i am not getting my use out of the echo dot and i really wish i could if any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know i got this for dad on fathers day he was tickled with it nice product love my echo love playing music in my room still getting used to alexa but i think she s a keeper works good for the most part you ask it some questions and she says she does nt know i thought she was supposed to know everything my new best friend   absolutely love it i liked linking more rooms in the home i love alexa she rocks i had some trouble with my echo dot when i got it because of internet connection issues after doing research online i saw from some other people that they had trouble with the generation echo dot however i took a trip and brought my echo dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine now back home the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through its little rough patch and i have nt had any problems since so if you are having connection issues with an echo dot then it is probably the internet and not the device small size works great in our sunroom i like it and its helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon i reached out to amazon because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use customer service could nt help they basically told me to contact sprint to assist so echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up so its kind of pointless to have and pay for it wo nt work as a blue tooth speaker with my tvit connects but wo nt work i ve only got to use it for before having to go into the hospital but had good time with it for the short time i did use it it was fun trying to use alexa this was an impulse buy but turns out i really enjoy my new dot my grands love requesting songs and playing games i like listening to my audible selection keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new alexa skills fun and practical my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home great product at a great price my son loves his echo dot love these great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering or listen to cnn live with serius sm i like it alot i connected it so i can play my pandora and i asked about the weather   time every morning i got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because i can have my music play unlimited on this i m going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once i get more comfortable with it definitely worth the money it plays music that i request i did nt like that almost everytime i asked alexa a question she would say i do nt know that or i have nt learned that luv it its a great product what can i say well i m a paranoid it person of but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control so yes i love my echo stuff but i did create a isolated vlan on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app be carful with these people entering your wifi password on a site that s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing try to stay with devices that work directly with the alexa hub with no thirdparty app amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the sensitive information is handled great product very helpful for playing music setting alarms and talking to you when you are lonely easy to set up can control kasa smart plugs no problem even the kids have figured stuff out that i would not have asked alexa like telling jokes and singing the alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam i love having alexa around the house my favorite features are her timers alarms and music especially her library of sleep sounds i got this product as a gift for my kids and they love her too she is great for reading time and timing for itthe only thing i really do nt like is that she has to be plugged in to an outlet to function no ifs ands or buts i get why but it is minorly inconvenient as i have to move her from room to room or purchase more lol alarmbed time story universal i am in love with alexa its was easy to set up    works better than anticipated this thing is awesome great product really like it i like that it respond most of my comands great product the volume is very low so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity my new best friend i m a little behind the times i ve never had anything like this another alexa or to me this is a super amazing useful tool i use it to play sleep sounds to sleep i use it for my amazon audible books set alarms reminders receive notifications play games with her have her tell me a short story lol its pretty fun i know some people complained about the speaker i m not sure why i m sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough but i rent a room and in my bedroom its perfect i do nt have any problems with the speaker love everything about it wish volume was capable of going louder i love it best purchase i love these i have dots and echo for a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although i do use external for the dots i really love my dots so awesome how its connects all my rooms but like you ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume which i m sure if i connected it to speaker or another device it would be great but as a stand alone the volume is just ok definitely not like my tall echo and the dots do nt pick up voice as good as my tall echostill totally love them and would recommend its okay but keeps dropping wifi kids love it i love it    love my echo dot easy to use and set up love it as i do all of my echos excellent product   i love being able to control lights doors and music fun to interact with very satisfied with the product we have echos now even one in the barn great idea for when i am working with my horse can still get news flashes   my music i bought this for my healing room i play continuous spa like music although alexa knows the type of music needed the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled i did nt know i had to buy speakers too like having the music where ever i am hard to hear had to blue tooth it to a better speaker no problems works as expected could have a better speaker i love it i want to get another one very very soon great to have along with the echo this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered daughter wanted a white boombox nothing good out for yr old decided to go echo dot for most any request   white bt good speaker she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet cheap and cheap sound this is pretty cool some times alexa is a little thick but mostly good love it do nt know what took me so long to get   and do nt know why i did nt get on amazon prime day up dated news works like a champ clear sound great alarm clock plays my music what else can you ask for oh yeah you can order what you need love that you can use your cell phone to call echo or dot you can also use echo and dot as intercoms love itjust like the other 4 i own great price i love my echo dot excellent bought another one works great love this my daughter enjoys telling alexa what to do haha purchased this for a discount on to insert into a portable bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with echo dot works great love it now i can bring alexa out onto the patio with me and i mostly use it for music this is our echo product and we love them just got my one love them the ease in installing excelente equipo inteligente conectado al internet nos provee de multiples funciones tales como el tiempohorainformacion de cualquier estudio que estes realizando atras internet for the price the product is nice quality and has a few nice features so definitely no complaints there the reason why i only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what i thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error i did nt know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work so i really do nt like that its not a stand alone device also the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a bluetooth speaker do nt lastly i m sure the echo dot can do a lot but i have nt quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own plus setting it up was awful i would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually alexa i love this product so far only because of the few things i can do with itsuch as set a timer a reminder play music and games i do nt like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things it was also very difficult to set up the directions made it sound as simple as one but they forgot about step five and six i was almost ready to send to backthe app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up however depending on what you are going to be using it for i think its an ok item love the echo dot its amaxing i like to use it for listening to podcasts i like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what s new the one thing i do nt like was getting it to recognize the radio station i wanted to listen to i finally got it working but had to work through the bugs just like its big sister the echo only smaller with slightly less audio fidelity but much lower price on amazon prime dayused in another room to add alexa to an additional room it does everything the big guy does great product   understands my accent love it ca nt stop using it really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house    very handy in the kitchen sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps cool little speakeri love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great it is s great tool helping with information used twice not working awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life great purchase i jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an echo i feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then the device is sharing news and weather now we use it some but have not tapped in to all options still testing it out love alexa love the echo dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom love it   now if i can only find the correct smart linksplug to connect this too work pretty well still learning it we really love our echo dot we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of usual reliable alexa speaker could be better qualty this device does not interact with my home filled with apple devices how disappointing have the echo wanted something smaller in another room they work together great love it it is so handy and easy to use got it for my classroom but i many need to just get another one very pleased primarily for music in our bedroom i wish the speaker had better fidelity nice music weather time great love it not all that happy the speaker is nt great and for some reason a lot of times when i play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop my son has a google home and it is much better not impressed i really like it   it takes a while to learn the uses and i m still learning alexa is phenomenal when you think about it this really does nt do much play music answer stupid questions finally it was able to hook up to thermostat i can see why price is dropping like a rock the echo generation smart speaker is very compound in size however it projects very good sound it also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker for greater projection of sound i also like it size because its not awkward and it does nt take up a lot of space it works great with the alexa app i also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing i use the echo dot several different ways in my home i use it downstairs to control lighting i also take it out on my deck to stream music to a bluetooth speaker it works great for what i need i have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom it was even easier to set up than my original echo makes turning on and off things in the house so simple great for little updates as well like checking the weather and such great product fun to use needs to be smarter i really enjoy being able to just make a request for my favorite music and it happens i have no complaints at this time love it works great making my home a smarthome i really like the echo dot its amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot convenient and fun its alright this is my alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation i love searching the alexa skill shop on the app useful things like having alexa turn my lights on and off listening to news updates and fun stuff like telling alexa to make the star trek red alert nois or playing song quiz with friends dot son loves it i love how compact it is this worked well for but then stopped connecting to the internet wifi and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked amazon customer service could nt help further and told me warranty was only 3 months which was very disappointing so they were nt willing to replace it talks to me plays the type of music i want to listen to and even turns off when i ask if to ask it to play motown radio on pandora and it keeps asking if i want to add a salsa station motown is nt close to salsa phonetically love it we are still learning the capabilities having a lot of fun easy to set up still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug grandkids think alex is cool i love it i use it for everything its a part of my daily routine the alexa program is great but the quality is not the best it could definitely be louder overall i like this though siri on my phone can do more for what i need as i do nt have a smart home and do nt intend to make it one but its fun and i use it for music and to have it read me my audible books alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy should nt have been released into the market without proper development speech recognition fails to understand basic and accentthe music it can play is very restrictive speech is nt refined in a way that we understand a almost a human is speaking linking to youtube via amazon web services does nt work set up is so easy love it i m amazed with the alarm i tell alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does i love the play list if music not sure if i do nt keep prime if music will still be available however i did love the fact amazon gave me music free for 3 monthsthey should have given prime free for as well i love all of the things that it can do i can play with it and learn from it been debating on getting one but am happy i did still more to explore thanks i m finding more and more uses for this all the time it keeps me informed with news and weather i can get a bible verse and have it play music new skills are added all the time the future is here i love to watch my wife argue with alexa i woke up listening to alexa talking to my cell phone       gave as a gift   they loved it the echo dot was everything that i expected and more i love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier i love my echo dot has many features and works greatthe only thing i do nt like about it is that i ca nt play my imusic on it i m going to have to pay for a spotify or amazon music account its great lots of fun easy setup alexa needs a lot of training echo dot purchased love the product i like the compact structure of the dot the sound is a little too low handy if you do nt expect much out of it much dumber than the assistant in my phone its easy to set up and use there are new features and skills added all the time love the product but dislike that i ca nt sync up my apple music for alexa to play have had for just one week so far and i can say it is a blast to have love it works like a charm good speaker for bedroom or office small speaker tin sound great with good bluetooth speaker fun and information no dislikes so far   like the convenience it was easy to set up and affordable love it i love that i can shut the microphone off at night so my children ca nt talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music not sure how i survived with out this for so long echo dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time the sound quality was nt great but it was inexpensive works great bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house it is nt bad for what it is have issues with it actually playing what i want getting it use iheartradio properly by playing the station i want is a challenge but its not bad for the sale price i paid its great but sound quality is very low i love it as always easy to set up it works ok this speaker quality is not much better than my iphone x i would spend the extra money to get the fullsize echo which has great sound quality very intelligent love the songs   review i love my echo dot the price i paid during prime day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles but this does so much more i can play music set alarms call friends play games set timersthe list goes on and on definitely worth the money sound is terrible can not pair with echo to play simultaneously must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play device at a time easy installation and set up better sound from the echo dot smart speaker very satisified with purchase i am spoiled by downstairsso got this one for upstairs to listen to music   etc while i walked on the treadmill    the commands alexa requires are too specific i find google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what i m asking for handy as hell recommend i am having real difficulty working with the echo dot alexi is not very smart out of questions i have asked i get the i m not sure the time i am still asking the question and alexi is saying i m not sure the music is great and works well for that all in all so far its been a very frustrating experience we are still in the discovery phase but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed totally gets out sense of humour we put one in the bedroom it plays music and tells us the weather it also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning it is better than a clock radio it will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites it can even tell jokes i do nt know how i got along without it before now amazing i like the echo but not sure about the dot i use it a lot for music and audio booksthe sound quality of this smaller echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model i have nt decided if ill keep it or not love it i got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes we love it better sound got this for my 2nd echo in the house i already have the regular echo the echo dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable wishing i would have just gone with another regular echo solely based on sound i was really happy with my original echo so i thought i d get an echo dot to use in my bedroom i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi presumably due to interference from the bluetooth then i connected a speaker via the auxiliary when i did that the auxiliary picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in by a horrible buzzing sound i m hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device listens well does way more than expected love her we are still testing this one out and so far we like it i was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our unfortunately it sometimes gets our wifi light bulbs mixed up and wo nt turn them on but we ve been able to manage and fix it i mean its convenient especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the dot i do like that it plays music and has reminders alarms etc   i m just still getting used to the fact that the man is always listening now works greathaving fun playing musicchecking weathera king questions small convenient and dependable this dot is a cutie and alexa does the job you askmy only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker alexa is perfect for people like me living alone at least i have someone to talk to to keep my sanity   though i wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers small footprint nice clarity easy set up great addition to my alexa base using it in my guest bedroom for music clock and infodot speaker is not as strong as the base but its a great value i had an alexia built into my thermostat that just did nt work very well i had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it i decided to try the echo dot since it was on prime day i have not been disappointed it hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem i really like that i can bluetooth connect to my bose speaker for quality sound i connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my google home mini ca nt do it works well this is so much fun to play with   i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell alexa to turn it of   alexa learns from the questions i ask she will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain if i wake up in the middle of the night i do not have to turn on a light i just ask alexa what time is it when i want the current weather she tells me ask her what going on in the city she knows call a friend she will dial   i have nt used that yet but she said she could if its in y contacts easy to set up and does everything its a poster despite its small size the speakers are adequate understands instructions from across the room very happy with the purchase a great product for the price works well perfect for a home office weak sound compared to the google home mini the sound is bad also you need prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything also if you get you need prime family music to play music on both i think its lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices it does what its suppose to do great product i love this item and being able to hear any kind of music i enjoyed it so much that i ordered another love the dot great item i m so glad i made the purchase and on prime day i m still learning how to use it i figured out it can read my kindle books to me which is a real bonus love having in our bedroom and in the kitchen great to drop in on family around the house so far so good not to tech savvy so i m still trying to figure out what i can do with it but it was easy to set up and so far easy to use lots of apps that it can use i will have to play with it some more but its fun to have echo dot responds to us when we are nt even talking to it i ve unplugged it it feels like its spying on us not connected to my phone playlist   i had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying of them for my home my wife is legally blind and can not use the computer this has been a godsend we have the amazon music for her and now she can listen to music check the weather get phone numbers make calls etc etc we are still learning but i tell you this is absolutely amazing i purchased more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on alexa with the wifi and direct cable capability the speakerstereo options are there for the choosing this is well worth the money you wo nt regret this at all perfect fast shipment and packaging worked as intended alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time love it i m addicted to this thing i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment the only reason i did nt give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo i would have been willing to pay more if it had a better speaker oh well it is what it is and i still love it i m just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but does nt take up a whole lot of space so far alli can say is i love it love my dots easy to use i have plus the echo spot one of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music   amazon iheart radio pandora great to play music throughout the house great and easily fits in my decor of my home i m obsessed with alexa she tells me the weather every morning she can play games we love the guess the song one and the one we have upstairs can turn off our tv downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if alexa will do it for you works well just disappointed with the speaker quality but hooked it up to old computer speakers easy setup easy use work with other smart products always learning what it can do we have so much fun with this so easy to use that even my loves talking to alexa i love my new echo dot right now i mainly use it to play music at night but it gets the job done we love this thing i wish i would have gotten it sooner you will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework there are loads of skills i am very happy with this purchase especially since i got it on prime day for price super easy to hook up and program i use the music feature the most but i love how i can set reminders from my phone and my echo will remind me at the set time its great for my news updates too it works just like my other dots set up was simple it recognizes my voice well it seams very intuitive i am enjoying its ease of use the only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality a massive difference from the alexa which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase thiswont be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve i was hoping the cord was white also otherwise it is fine i like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list set and alarm play any song i can think of and much more i wish the sound could be a tad louder too soon i m still learning what i can do with it enjoying it and still learning all the commands ran into frustrating issue it was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household i love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices works great i like almost everything amazing it has helped me become better organized gives me traffic updates weather updates and helps me maintain a good fast morning routine my kids love alexa skills are amazing would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions great definitely gets a little old after a while but for 30 i ca nt really regret it at all love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to the smiths love it added it to an upstairs bedroom got to love alexa she does everything around our house works great and easy to set up my echo device very easy to set up works perfectly easy to set up and start using works as advertised    love our little dot i do nt know what the original larger alexa can do that the dot can not do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities really like it works as expected this is our one our son loves it in his room easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it love it dislike the volume it does not sound loud enough love alexa i own 2 and gave for a gift which was a huge hit as expected i did nt order it i love this technology i m older but this is so easy to set up and use i have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything i use my echo for which is in the living room use as my dot bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and does nt have access to phone amazing product still learnimg all the things it can do does what i expected and more the product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from below my sister has   and even that one has bluetooth and does nt need to be plugged in the only good thing about this is that you can speak to it i have a friend now its easier to do things with it good device overall love it there are just some commands which are nt effective it may be part user error or alexa becoming accustom to what is being asked these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house lol we would nt be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs works great love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices i love it it is just what i thought it would be i m addicted works beautifully excellent sound still learning everything she can do good for a room volume is pretty good without an additional speaker neat tool we enjoy it with the family easy to connect and the skills created for our echo 2nd gen worked fine with the dot i live alone this is the best companion easy to set up and connect with smart devices just what i needed love it i personally prefer spotify music so its great that i was able to set that as default there s not a day that goes by without music in our home also the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave so we tell alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders he s a lot more calmer and does nt bark when we lock the door and start walking away its a must have love it it works great alexa still has some problems but it is getting better every day i m not an expert but i think the sound quality is fine not perfect but good this is my echo to purchase   the price was so cheap   i m seriously thinking of buying more   i use alexa for everything   its the next best thing to the internet   i love it bought one for my daughter and for myself    it is just not as loud as i thought it was going to be i enjoy it still discovering new uses being able to add speakers is a plus i take it on my deck when i am outside just love it i have my big alexia in my bedroom excellent device   works great having no problems or concerns its pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but does nt understand my commands some of the time    i like the hands free operation vs the tap we use both for controlling smart plugs i dislike that it confuses my requests all the time    love my alexa actually have throughout the house favorite function is lists great for time management and if course music this product is easy to use and very entertaining i have yet to hook it up to my tv or lights but look forward to doing so    works great but speaker is not the good for music will need to get a bluetooth speaker outstanding product   easy to use works great we have of these throughout our home and they are great there are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening there should be more options to change the name of the engagement command alexa or computer are a little annoying more colors then black and white would also be a good thing use the product for music and its great easy to setup and to use it works great i like having more alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting phenomenal i loved it does exactly what it says i used it to control my smart home devices works great very convenient este producto llego y a la semana se quedo sin olor perdio toda su escencia huele solo a alcohol easy to set up ready to use in barry    my loves it good for doing basic household tasks were going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs awesome device wish i bought love it perfect for kids adults and everyone in between listening to music searching locations checking time looking up weather there are many more task to learn it was simple to set up i do love these things i have them running my entire home tv all my lights my thermostat my front door dead bolt the cameras and i love listening to npr these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek i named mine computer to get the feel but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems only complaint i have is that the sound quality is nt great i mostly use it for commands though and i have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through i have a couple friends that have a dot and do nt mind the audio quality but if you re bothered by that kind of thing i d go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers good nice little unit no issues the echo dot was easy to set up and use it helps provide music etc to small spaces and was just what i was looking for i set her up to play through our home theater system so fat we are just using her for weather forecasts cooking timers and we really enjoy the music small device that my kids like to ask questions very handy friendly interactive beyond awesome i like that it responds every time it was easy to set up i m still learning what i can do with it i may like a better speaker more family loved it    i like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the google only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker easy to use echos are great i have a few of them through out our home   all in voice range to ask a question say a command to turn lights on or off or my favorite is play music all though the house love it   this time its a gift for friend fantastic product i use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program great i am quite disappointed by this productthere clearly is a bug of the time i ask for a newsflash two second after it starts the whole thing stops and reboots for same goes when i ask to play the radio also many times it get confused when i ask to switch of the lightsas other items are also named the same which is not true clearly no ai or natural language very beta stage still for me not impressed love this thing works great and kids love it to love it makes the simple things in life simpler i am really enjoying the many different features on my alexa especially listening to music and audio books echo dot is a wonderful invention we love it alexa is so smart alarm and music information the weather love it very helpful good but its pretty low alarm calendar reminders i have had the echo dot for and am having fun with it i set morning alarms check the weather have alexa play various music i bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound and i m learning her skills a little tricky to connect to wifi initially but after some trial and error it connected and has stayed connected so far super satisfied will be buying one for my mother and one for my office i am completely in love does absolutely everything and is so amazing and great nope still a lot to be improved for most of the things we ask it says hmmmm i do nt know that the speaker could be better i love it dot love it works like any other one love my new alexa she works great so far i bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and i was excited when it came in i set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine the set up was easy and straight forward which i really appreciated because i am terrible with technology the only reason why i am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that i ca nt use the echo dot for without it disconnecting from the internet i am connected to both and wifi links and neither works its very frustrating because i am not getting my use out of the echo dot and i really wish i could if any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know i got this for dad on fathers day he was tickled with it nice product love my echo love playing music in my room still getting used to alexa but i think she s a keeper works good for the most part you ask it some questions and she says she does nt know i thought she was supposed to know everything my new best friend   absolutely love it i liked linking more rooms in the home i love alexa she rocks i had some trouble with my echo dot when i got it because of internet connection issues after doing research online i saw from some other people that they had trouble with the generation echo dot however i took a trip and brought my echo dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine now back home the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through its little rough patch and i have nt had any problems since so if you are having connection issues with an echo dot then it is probably the internet and not the device small size works great in our sunroom i like it and its helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon i reached out to amazon because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use customer service could nt help they basically told me to contact sprint to assist so echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up so its kind of pointless to have and pay for it wo nt work as a blue tooth speaker with my tvit connects but wo nt work i ve only got to use it for before having to go into the hospital but had good time with it for the short time i did use it it was fun trying to use alexa this was an impulse buy but turns out i really enjoy my new dot my grands love requesting songs and playing games i like listening to my audible selection keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new alexa skills fun and practical my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home great product at a great price my son loves his echo dot love these great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering or listen to cnn live with serius sm i like it alot i connected it so i can play my pandora and i asked about the weather   time every morning i got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because i can have my music play unlimited on this i m going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once i get more comfortable with it definitely worth the money it plays music that i request i did nt like that almost everytime i asked alexa a question she would say i do nt know that or i have nt learned that luv it its a great product what can i say well i m a paranoid it person of but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control so yes i love my echo stuff but i did create a isolated vlan on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app be carful with these people entering your wifi password on a site that s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing try to stay with devices that work directly with the alexa hub with no thirdparty app amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the sensitive information is handled great product very helpful for playing music setting alarms and talking to you when you are lonely easy to set up can control kasa smart plugs no problem even the kids have figured stuff out that i would not have asked alexa like telling jokes and singing the alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam i love having alexa around the house my favorite features are her timers alarms and music especially her library of sleep sounds i got this product as a gift for my kids and they love her too she is great for reading time and timing for itthe only thing i really do nt like is that she has to be plugged in to an outlet to function no ifs ands or buts i get why but it is minorly inconvenient as i have to move her from room to room or purchase more lol alarmbed time story universal i am in love with alexa its was easy to set up    works better than anticipated this thing is awesome great product really like it i like that it respond most of my comands great product the volume is very low so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity my new best friend i m a little behind the times i ve never had anything like this another alexa or to me this is a super amazing useful tool i use it to play sleep sounds to sleep i use it for my amazon audible books set alarms reminders receive notifications play games with her have her tell me a short story lol its pretty fun i know some people complained about the speaker i m not sure why i m sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough but i rent a room and in my bedroom its perfect i do nt have any problems with the speaker love everything about it wish volume was capable of going louder i love it best purchase i love these i have dots and echo for a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although i do use external for the dots i really love my dots so awesome how its connects all my rooms but like you ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume which i m sure if i connected it to speaker or another device it would be great but as a stand alone the volume is just ok definitely not like my tall echo and the dots do nt pick up voice as good as my tall echostill totally love them and would recommend its okay but keeps dropping wifi kids love it i love it    love my echo dot easy to use and set up love it as i do all of my echos excellent product   i love being able to control lights doors and music fun to interact with very satisfied with the product we have echos now even one in the barn great idea for when i am working with my horse can still get news flashes   my music i bought this for my healing room i play continuous spa like music although alexa knows the type of music needed the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled i did nt know i had to buy speakers too like having the music where ever i am hard to hear had to blue tooth it to a better speaker no problems works as expected could have a better speaker i love it i want to get another one very very soon great to have along with the echo this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered daughter wanted a white boombox nothing good out for yr old decided to go echo dot for most any request   white bt good speaker she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet cheap and cheap sound this is pretty cool some times alexa is a little thick but mostly good love it do nt know what took me so long to get   and do nt know why i did nt get on amazon prime day up dated news works like a champ clear sound great alarm clock plays my music what else can you ask for oh yeah you can order what you need love that you can use your cell phone to call echo or dot you can also use echo and dot as intercoms love itjust like the other 4 i own great price i love my echo dot excellent bought another one works great love this my daughter enjoys telling alexa what to do haha purchased this for a discount on to insert into a portable bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with echo dot works great love it now i can bring alexa out onto the patio with me and i mostly use it for music this is our echo product and we love them just got my one love them the ease in installing excelente equipo inteligente conectado al internet nos provee de multiples funciones tales como el tiempohorainformacion de cualquier estudio que estes realizando atras internet for the price the product is nice quality and has a few nice features so definitely no complaints there the reason why i only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what i thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error i did nt know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work so i really do nt like that its not a stand alone device also the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a bluetooth speaker do nt lastly i m sure the echo dot can do a lot but i have nt quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own plus setting it up was awful i would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually alexa i love this product so far only because of the few things i can do with itsuch as set a timer a reminder play music and games i do nt like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things it was also very difficult to set up the directions made it sound as simple as one but they forgot about step five and six i was almost ready to send to backthe app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up however depending on what you are going to be using it for i think its an ok item love the echo dot its amaxing i like to use it for listening to podcasts i like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what s new the one thing i do nt like was getting it to recognize the radio station i wanted to listen to i finally got it working but had to work through the bugs just like its big sister the echo only smaller with slightly less audio fidelity but much lower price on amazon prime dayused in another room to add alexa to an additional room it does everything the big guy does great product   understands my accent love it ca nt stop using it really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house    very handy in the kitchen sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps cool little speakeri love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great it is s great tool helping with information used twice not working awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life great purchase i jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an echo i feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then the device is sharing news and weather now we use it some but have not tapped in to all options still testing it out love alexa love the echo dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom love it   now if i can only find the correct smart linksplug to connect this too work pretty well still learning it we really love our echo dot we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of usual reliable alexa speaker could be better qualty this device does not interact with my home filled with apple devices how disappointing have the echo wanted something smaller in another room they work together great love it it is so handy and easy to use got it for my classroom but i many need to just get another one very pleased primarily for music in our bedroom i wish the speaker had better fidelity nice music weather time great love it not all that happy the speaker is nt great and for some reason a lot of times when i play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop my son has a google home and it is much better not impressed i really like it   it takes a while to learn the uses and i m still learning alexa is phenomenal when you think about it this really does nt do much play music answer stupid questions finally it was able to hook up to thermostat i can see why price is dropping like a rock the echo generation smart speaker is very compound in size however it projects very good sound it also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker for greater projection of sound i also like it size because its not awkward and it does nt take up a lot of space it works great with the alexa app i also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing i use the echo dot several different ways in my home i use it downstairs to control lighting i also take it out on my deck to stream music to a bluetooth speaker it works great for what i need i have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom it was even easier to set up than my original echo makes turning on and off things in the house so simple great for little updates as well like checking the weather and such great product fun to use needs to be smarter i really enjoy being able to just make a request for my favorite music and it happens i have no complaints at this time love it works great making my home a smarthome i really like the echo dot its amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot convenient and fun its alright this is my alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation i love searching the alexa skill shop on the app useful things like having alexa turn my lights on and off listening to news updates and fun stuff like telling alexa to make the star trek red alert nois or playing song quiz with friends dot son loves it i love how compact it is this worked well for but then stopped connecting to the internet wifi and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked amazon customer service could nt help further and told me warranty was only 3 months which was very disappointing so they were nt willing to replace it talks to me plays the type of music i want to listen to and even turns off when i ask if to ask it to play motown radio on pandora and it keeps asking if i want to add a salsa station motown is nt close to salsa phonetically love it we are still learning the capabilities having a lot of fun easy to set up still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug grandkids think alex is cool i love it i use it for everything its a part of my daily routine the alexa program is great but the quality is not the best it could definitely be louder overall i like this though siri on my phone can do more for what i need as i do nt have a smart home and do nt intend to make it one but its fun and i use it for music and to have it read me my audible books alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy should nt have been released into the market without proper development speech recognition fails to understand basic and accentthe music it can play is very restrictive speech is nt refined in a way that we understand a almost a human is speaking linking to youtube via amazon web services does nt work set up is so easy love it i m amazed with the alarm i tell alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does i love the play list if music not sure if i do nt keep prime if music will still be available however i did love the fact amazon gave me music free for 3 monthsthey should have given prime free for as well i love all of the things that it can do i can play with it and learn from it been debating on getting one but am happy i did still more to explore thanks i m finding more and more uses for this all the time it keeps me informed with news and weather i can get a bible verse and have it play music new skills are added all the time the future is here i love to watch my wife argue with alexa i woke up listening to alexa talking to my cell phone       gave as a gift   they loved it the echo dot was everything that i expected and more i love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier i love my echo dot has many features and works greatthe only thing i do nt like about it is that i ca nt play my imusic on it i m going to have to pay for a spotify or amazon music account its great lots of fun easy setup alexa needs a lot of training echo dot purchased love the product i like the compact structure of the dot the sound is a little too low handy if you do nt expect much out of it much dumber than the assistant in my phone its easy to set up and use there are new features and skills added all the time love the product but dislike that i ca nt sync up my apple music for alexa to play have had for just one week so far and i can say it is a blast to have love it works like a charm good speaker for bedroom or office small speaker tin sound great with good bluetooth speaker fun and information no dislikes so far   like the convenience it was easy to set up and affordable love it i love that i can shut the microphone off at night so my children ca nt talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music not sure how i survived with out this for so long echo dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time the sound quality was nt great but it was inexpensive works great bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house it is nt bad for what it is have issues with it actually playing what i want getting it use iheartradio properly by playing the station i want is a challenge but its not bad for the sale price i paid its great but sound quality is very low i love it as always easy to set up it works ok this speaker quality is not much better than my iphone x i would spend the extra money to get the fullsize echo which has great sound quality very intelligent love the songs   review i love my echo dot the price i paid during prime day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles but this does so much more i can play music set alarms call friends play games set timersthe list goes on and on definitely worth the money sound is terrible can not pair with echo to play simultaneously must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play device at a time easy installation and set up better sound from the echo dot smart speaker very satisified with purchase i am spoiled by downstairsso got this one for upstairs to listen to music   etc while i walked on the treadmill    the commands alexa requires are too specific i find google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what i m asking for handy as hell recommend i am having real difficulty working with the echo dot alexi is not very smart out of questions i have asked i get the i m not sure the time i am still asking the question and alexi is saying i m not sure the music is great and works well for that all in all so far its been a very frustrating experience we are still in the discovery phase but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed totally gets out sense of humour we put one in the bedroom it plays music and tells us the weather it also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning it is better than a clock radio it will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites it can even tell jokes i do nt know how i got along without it before now amazing i like the echo but not sure about the dot i use it a lot for music and audio booksthe sound quality of this smaller echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model i have nt decided if ill keep it or not love it i got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes we love it better sound got this for my 2nd echo in the house i already have the regular echo the echo dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable wishing i would have just gone with another regular echo solely based on sound i was really happy with my original echo so i thought i d get an echo dot to use in my bedroom i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi presumably due to interference from the bluetooth then i connected a speaker via the auxiliary when i did that the auxiliary picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in by a horrible buzzing sound i m hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device listens well does way more than expected love her we are still testing this one out and so far we like it i was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our unfortunately it sometimes gets our wifi light bulbs mixed up and wo nt turn them on but we ve been able to manage and fix it i mean its convenient especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the dot i do like that it plays music and has reminders alarms etc   i m just still getting used to the fact that the man is always listening now works greathaving fun playing musicchecking weathera king questions small convenient and dependable this dot is a cutie and alexa does the job you askmy only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker alexa is perfect for people like me living alone at least i have someone to talk to to keep my sanity   though i wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers small footprint nice clarity easy set up great addition to my alexa base using it in my guest bedroom for music clock and infodot speaker is not as strong as the base but its a great value i had an alexia built into my thermostat that just did nt work very well i had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it i decided to try the echo dot since it was on prime day i have not been disappointed it hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem i really like that i can bluetooth connect to my bose speaker for quality sound i connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my google home mini ca nt do it works well this is so much fun to play with   i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell alexa to turn it of   alexa learns from the questions i ask she will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain if i wake up in the middle of the night i do not have to turn on a light i just ask alexa what time is it when i want the current weather she tells me ask her what going on in the city she knows call a friend she will dial   i have nt used that yet but she said she could if its in y contacts easy to set up and does everything its a poster despite its small size the speakers are adequate understands instructions from across the room very happy with the purchase a great product for the price works well perfect for a home office weak sound compared to the google home mini the sound is bad also you need prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything also if you get you need prime family music to play music on both i think its lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices it does what its suppose to do great product i love this item and being able to hear any kind of music i enjoyed it so much that i ordered another love the dot great item i m so glad i made the purchase and on prime day i m still learning how to use it i figured out it can read my kindle books to me which is a real bonus love having in our bedroom and in the kitchen great to drop in on family around the house so far so good not to tech savvy so i m still trying to figure out what i can do with it but it was easy to set up and so far easy to use lots of apps that it can use i will have to play with it some more but its fun to have echo dot responds to us when we are nt even talking to it i ve unplugged it it feels like its spying on us not connected to my phone playlist   i had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying of them for my home my wife is legally blind and can not use the computer this has been a godsend we have the amazon music for her and now she can listen to music check the weather get phone numbers make calls etc etc we are still learning but i tell you this is absolutely amazing i purchased more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on alexa with the wifi and direct cable capability the speakerstereo options are there for the choosing this is well worth the money you wo nt regret this at all perfect fast shipment and packaging worked as intended alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time love it i m addicted to this thing i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment the only reason i did nt give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo i would have been willing to pay more if it had a better speaker oh well it is what it is and i still love it i m just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but does nt take up a whole lot of space so far alli can say is i love it love my dots easy to use i have plus the echo spot one of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music   amazon iheart radio pandora great to play music throughout the house great and easily fits in my decor of my home i m obsessed with alexa she tells me the weather every morning she can play games we love the guess the song one and the one we have upstairs can turn off our tv downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if alexa will do it for you works well just disappointed with the speaker quality but hooked it up to old computer speakers easy setup easy use work with other smart products always learning what it can do we have so much fun with this so easy to use that even my loves talking to alexa i love my new echo dot right now i mainly use it to play music at night but it gets the job done we love this thing i wish i would have gotten it sooner you will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework there are loads of skills i am very happy with this purchase especially since i got it on prime day for price super easy to hook up and program i use the music feature the most but i love how i can set reminders from my phone and my echo will remind me at the set time its great for my news updates too it works just like my other dots set up was simple it recognizes my voice well it seams very intuitive i am enjoying its ease of use the only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality a massive difference from the alexa which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase thiswont be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve i was hoping the cord was white also otherwise it is fine i like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list set and alarm play any song i can think of and much more i wish the sound could be a tad louder too soon i m still learning what i can do with it enjoying it and still learning all the commands ran into frustrating issue it was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household i love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices works great i like almost everything amazing it has helped me become better organized gives me traffic updates weather updates and helps me maintain a good fast morning routine my kids love alexa skills are amazing would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions great definitely gets a little old after a while but for 30 i ca nt really regret it at all love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to the smiths love it added it to an upstairs bedroom got to love alexa she does everything around our house works great and easy to set up my echo device very easy to set up works perfectly easy to set up and start using works as advertised    love our little dot i do nt know what the original larger alexa can do that the dot can not do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities really like it works as expected this is our one our son loves it in his room easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it love it dislike the volume it does not sound loud enough love alexa i own 2 and gave for a gift which was a huge hit as expected i did nt order it i love this technology i m older but this is so easy to set up and use i have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything i use my echo for which is in the living room use as my dot bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and does nt have access to phone amazing product still learnimg all the things it can do does what i expected and more the product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from below my sister has   and even that one has bluetooth and does nt need to be plugged in the only good thing about this is that you can speak to it i have a friend now its easier to do things with it good device overall love it there are just some commands which are nt effective it may be part user error or alexa becoming accustom to what is being asked these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house lol we would nt be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs works great love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices i love it it is just what i thought it would be i m addicted works beautifully excellent sound still learning everything she can do good for a room volume is pretty good without an additional speaker neat tool we enjoy it with the family easy to connect and the skills created for our echo 2nd gen worked fine with the dot i live alone this is the best companion easy to set up and connect with smart devices just what i needed love it i personally prefer spotify music so its great that i was able to set that as default there s not a day that goes by without music in our home also the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave so we tell alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders he s a lot more calmer and does nt bark when we lock the door and start walking away its a must have love it it works great alexa still has some problems but it is getting better every day i m not an expert but i think the sound quality is fine not perfect but good this is my echo to purchase   the price was so cheap   i m seriously thinking of buying more   i use alexa for everything   its the next best thing to the internet   i love it bought one for my daughter and for myself    it is just not as loud as i thought it was going to be i enjoy it still discovering new uses being able to add speakers is a plus i take it on my deck when i am outside just love it i have my big alexia in my bedroom excellent device   works great having no problems or concerns its pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but does nt understand my commands some of the time    i like the hands free operation vs the tap we use both for controlling smart plugs i dislike that it confuses my requests all the time    love my alexa actually have throughout the house favorite function is lists great for time management and if course music this product is easy to use and very entertaining i have yet to hook it up to my tv or lights but look forward to doing so    works great but speaker is not the good for music will need to get a bluetooth speaker outstanding product   easy to use works great we have of these throughout our home and they are great there are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening there should be more options to change the name of the engagement command alexa or computer are a little annoying more colors then black and white would also be a good thing use the product for music and its great easy to setup and to use it works great i like having more alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting phenomenal i loved it does exactly what it says i used it to control my smart home devices works great very convenient este producto llego y a la semana se quedo sin olor perdio toda su escencia huele solo a alcohol easy to set up ready to use in barry    my loves it good for doing basic household tasks were going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs awesome device wish i bought love it perfect for kids adults and everyone in between listening to music searching locations checking time looking up weather there are many more task to learn it was simple to set up i do love these things i have them running my entire home tv all my lights my thermostat my front door dead bolt the cameras and i love listening to npr these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek i named mine computer to get the feel but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems only complaint i have is that the sound quality is nt great i mostly use it for commands though and i have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through i have a couple friends that have a dot and do nt mind the audio quality but if you re bothered by that kind of thing i d go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers

integrates seamlessly with my other amazon servicescant wait to get for my classroom too its a lot of fun even just as a speaker let alone what i plan to do with it i love my echo show and now i have this in my bedroom and its wonderful music info sleeping sounds awesome life changer seriously i am able to start my morning with alexa by having her wakeme up with her alarm and then playing me some music she has gotten used to my voice that i can be in another room and she will listen to what i say i love both my echos dont hesitate get one and for the price the speaker is unbelievable i am buying the cordless holder so i can take the echo anywhere love my purchase and love alexa i am not super impressed with alexa when my prime lapsed she wouldnt play anything she isnt smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we cant use it for that either she randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her just today i unplugged hernot sure ill ever use my alexa again i like

size all the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family enjoyed entire echo experience easy to set up the echo is an amazing device many times it seems very intuitive but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result installation was fairly straightforward but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it wasnt this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next stepmy biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done however i cant make any of the echos aware of the others existence when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions a small deal

echo 2nd generation it is so nice to have alexa available for music weather news and probably a lot more we havent discovered i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo if you are a big fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj you can even have conversations with the echo i am not embarrassed to say that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke it tells me where my packages are since

not as good as the better echo products took a little work to set up but i finally got it sound quality not the best but for what i got it for it works great i check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it i do play the radio on it when i want some music but will probably upgrade to the echo plus for better sound love alexa these are the best thing i have ever bought dont know how i ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to i loved it it works great extremely low in volume i had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone i ended up using my computer it is interesting that the answers come from wikipedia however i will give echo dot an a in the music playing department i heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations also amusing when alexa responds i dont know that why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing if i had paid full price for this gadget i would have been sorely disappointed now it seems reasonable and a step above hal brought to replace one that i moved and doesnt have the same range as my previous non refurbished

working followed all instructions for alexa echo dot and it did not come on very upsetting sent it back due to crackling noise and turning itself off and on  but what can you expect with a refurbished

there is no way for me to have amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options i love amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let downupdate amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter this is why i shop on amazon i can always trust them to deliver on their products i bought this for a family member as a gift i

size all the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family enjoyed entire echo experience easy to set up the echo is an amazing device many times it seems very intuitive but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result installation was fairly straightforward but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it wasnt this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next stepmy biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done however i cant make any of the echos aware of the others existence when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions a small deal

echo 2nd generation it is so nice to have alexa available for music weather news and probably a lot more we havent discovered i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo if you are a big fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj you can even have conversations with the echo i am not embarrassed to say that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke it tells me where my packages are since

i know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read but i disagree honestly i like it but at the same time i dont i could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half i bought it for the video chat and i have never really used it overall its great and i like that i can see lyrics and the time and date however sometimes it freezes and doesnt respond properlyno error message about lack of connectivityit just stops resetting resolves the problem i love all that you can do with the echo spot the thing i like most about my echo spot is the voice

does so much got rid of my old cdalarm clock radio much more room on nightstand great sound and video plus all the great stuff that alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off the ease to use product so far pretty happy with the spot for me it really is a glorified alarm clockradio and i know i could have something more cost effective but eh i like it i had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did so far so good i am just entering the smart technology world i havent figured it all out yet but so far its pretty cool it was smaller than i had anticipated and when i say that i very much mean it however it still works very well quality sound easily programmed easy to work with but alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs   love my echo spot great deal great product perfect i had a couple of echo dots previously  bought these specifically for the ring doorbell video  cloud cam display  interface capabilities was not disappointed love the fact that i can ask to see front yard  back yard  front door etcthe video chat with the other rooms is also quite coolbonus alexa show me ant man trailer etci know this can all be done on laptopdesktop but its cool now having an appliance thats always just there and it doesnt interrupt what im doing bought this for my bedroom and the show for my living room love them both the spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design shows lyrics photos  etc i paired it with a smart plug for the bedroom lamps alexa turn off lights love it love that is can do so much it sits on my nightstand only improvements i would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger but overall im happy i have it would recommend it was a gift and the recipient love love loves it  cool little piece of techwere still learning some of its functions and possibilities but i can see some potential even my technically challenged wife already figured out how to video call our daughter i have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock it is the perfect bedside counter device  alarm wake up music weather top news stories etc perfect device for what i wanted and does so much more than i expected it to do calling feature is also a huge selling point this is a must own item probably will grab more echos in the future as an alexa device it works just as well as any of the other products unfortunately it doesnt go up from there the ability to play videos is very limited you can not play youtube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange there is quite a selection of clock faces and you can control what is displays with

nice i like it   weve owned a number of echo devices but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool other than playing music through a sound system we havent found much use for them we just dont find the voice user interface to be all that efficient the echo spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that youre routinely interested in furthermore you can do some basic

hardcore fan of echo infact i am in love with all members of my alexa family i have echo echo dot echo plus and now this new toddler echo spot every variant has its own beauty i love feel and size of echo spot its fabulous as far as looks are concerned it does not have great audio quality which i did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size i bought it to connect with my bose soundtouch love this i love being able to have alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for alexa doesnt work as well as the normal echo sometimes alexa doesnt hear me when i try to interrupt her it to give new instructions the speaker also isnt as good as the normal echo screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing whos at the front door but its great for the bedside fun tech toy love it small with good sound with the combination of this smart plugins and the alex app i can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling alexa to do it i can order stuff get answers watch videos get weather set alarms video call and so much more with this device great product in a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house extrimelly useful hub of information music automation communication and assistant in basic needs would love to have a voice personalization some things are better not to said aloud but typed like door unlocking codes but that is problem of unwitty developers so far only positive experience the privacy invasions is happened way before alexa it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier to alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off i love this device its so great what a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker only reason i didnt give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing youtube videos and google play music the camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and its dark in the roomother than those minor things i love it great buy and would buy again hands free control great love the display and easy to use though still learning what all it can do everyday it has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start even from a distance a lot of the skills are excellent ive added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but its ridiculous that it cant access youtubeit might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event i imagine this is a functionality people would use often setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock great product highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it it sits much better on the

is great so even if its sitting fairly high up you can still see the display well enough quick and easy to set up i was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement  the

cleaning ladies came through we mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off while leaving the fan running only gripe would be the mic sensitivity which doesnt appear be as good as the view or gen2 it can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself this product has made my life much simpler with a little one i use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it onoff or updown is a breeze the screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news works well and was easy to set up love my spot it now acts as my new alarm this is the one of my favorite amazon devices have one in my bedroom and use as alarm clock perfect addition to our home of alexa devices wasnt so sure about bringing smart technology into my home but im hooked i love the sleek look of the echo spot on my nightstand and how easy it was to set up and use i also love that it scrolls the news local weather and give suggestions of what to ask alexa i use this as my alarm clock speaker and have it syncd with the etekcity voltson wifi smart plugs to control the lighting in my apartment love it you need a harvard law degree to operate this thing its going back very soon love it getting use to it and alexa is getting use to my voice  sometimes she doesnt answer but i think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice isnt strong over all i havent had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about thank goodness i didnt listen to those reviews and paid attention to the apple guy  product turns on randomly and sometimes at night i used it as an alarm clock i lov it it was much smaller than i was expecting for the cost im amazed alexa wakes me up everyday for work to whatever station on iheart radio or spotify i want plus when i do get smart home devices shell be even more useful to me shes really helpful with answering random questions the small screen sucks for video as it is small and round but its nice to have something to show time and pictures fun so farstill learning how it all works i purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because i found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking cutting cleaning etc especially when our counters arent very wide to begin with after going back and forth between this and the show i decided on this because i felt it had all the same features but is more compact i can honestly say i have no regrets while i probably wouldnt watch a movie id been dying to see on this its a great way to listen to music watch a quick youtube video etc i even attempted watching jaws on this and while it wasnt the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do it wasnt as bad as one would think i would definitely recommend we love the echo spot i use it on my nightstand for alarm clock and play iheartradio radio while getting dressed it was easy set up i use it more than i thought i would love this but there is no way to stop the screen from constantly scrolling through things to try if amazon would make this a setting i would change my review to 5 stars i am a small business owner with no staff with the alexa driven echo spot i feel like ive hired my first assistant my echo spot keeps me organized updated and assistance when i need information that will help my day run more smoothly i love my echo spot so much i bought 2 more for my kids who love their echo spot too i highly recommend this productsuggested improvement for future versions make the echo spot wireless  bedroom clock  ask questions weather reportsalarm clock  music  download

over the spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications i have not seen the spot really do much for package notifications yet the dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered i would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot  the dot lights up colors  why cant the spot  the same way you command alexa and you get that blue

i expected sound quality is good too also its not so bright that i have to turn off the screen but it is an option i have a dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds

fantastic potential these have  for digital photo screen video calls easy accesss to music audio books etc however once we have them setup we discovered the huge lurking negative amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their alexa features you can turn off many other things in settins but you cannot turn off things to try instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time  we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says try  amazon please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this spam the best part about owning this is that my mother who is antitechnology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well well done its my second one so i put this one in the kitchen for recipes

stop alexa and ask again and again also it should be able to access the wikipedia dictionary in many areas with better and fast accessneeds to hear us better also we should be able to name it on our

research after something doesnt work this echo plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life i purchased the amazon echo plus on amazon prime day because i need a hub im in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home for the same price as some hubs and even less expensive in some other cases i got a hub that works with my devices plus it does a lot more i havent even had time to go through all the skills it has but ive already found myself using many of them when i started a search for a hub i wasnt even considering the echo in part because i didnt know it was a hub but also because i didnt really think i would find much use for another ai system if youre looking for a hub why settle for a plane hub when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet costs the same or less than other hubs oh and by the way for the same price as the amazon echo plus alone i found one that came bundled with a smart bulb  saw another that came with a smart plug given the price of these extras well that just put the echo plus over the top im so happy that i purchased alexa when i recently saw this at a friends home he played some music while talking about the product i love the sound  love that all i have to do is tell alexa or ask a question  she responds immediately i havent been able to listen to my cds for a while since i have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that its not an issue any longer after we learned to use this we are still learning we are very pleased with echo plus i love it  used one like this in philly while visiting my son and decided to buy my own on prime day  the speakers on these devices are surprisingly good the functionality of each echo device is fantastic as advertised connected my smart bulbs with no problems it works perfect love warehouse buys if this was just in good used condition then new must be newer than new seriously this one was

is confused by my changing names for where i sit no it is broke and i cant get help fixing or replacing it im still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub so bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and i was looking forward to this feature being able to play music check the weather etc is fine sounds great have not used the hub yet is as expected and more responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the amazon app i also bought the philipshue light bulb and all i had to do was put it in my lamp and tell alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands sound is better it is as if we are having a conversation with another person instantaneous response and the fact that it catches your command even when youre far from it is simply just amazing although i havent taken advantage of many of the echos features there is one that bothers me it starts talking even when i havent said anything even close to the wake up word  echo  had to change from alexa due to a conflict with another

off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors you also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for medo not buy this if you want a full featured hub for

and sounds great this is a very useful device i use it to turn my lights on and off around the house it works with all the other alexa devices so i can give a command near any of them and this will process the request it also handles all the functions that the other devices can do i enjoy it much more than i thought i would i love my echo plus how can you not like the echo plus it has the built

purchase anything smart home because i am just not good with electronics however this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the bluetooth in my sound bar for my tv which provides extra sound for music i can make calls and finally hear people when home i do not have cable only the paid apps like netflix and hulu so when alexa provided me news stations weather and other updates it was

voice recognition and music play capability is the same the original echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i dont really need the hub with less functionality in addition i dont think that amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end

for our toy hauler but it came the day before we left for a trip by plane it was wonderful to plug into our hotel tv and watch our normal tv shows rather than whatever was showing at the time and sit through commercials already had a firestick in our livingroom great entertainment had to get one for the bedroom very good option purchased to use on the road in my semi does not work in that application great i love my fire stick thank you so much easy to setup i am enjoying the added video choices for my television the installation and connection to my wifi was so easy getting the amazon

really wanted to like it but when i couldnt install that particular app it became almost useless almost does most other stuff just fine but ill stick with my roku this thing is great if you have internet and amazon prime awesome product easy set up nice looking interface and i like the new slightly larger remote i have a 1st gen with the little remote and misplace it all the time and great price great product and easy to use great gadget that installs and works easily nice to not have another box taking up space too excellent product and service very easy to install and my daughter is very happy great entertainment being able to use it with my alexa echo was great easy to use and fast setup love it i set her up to play through our home theater system so fat we are just using her for weather forecasts cooking timers and we really enjoy the music small device that my kids like to ask questions very handy friendly interactive beyond awesome i like that it responds every time it was easy to set up im still learning what i can do with it i may like a better speaker more family loved it   i like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the google only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker easy to use echos are great i have a few of them through out our home  all in voice range to ask a question say a command to turn lights on or off or my favorite is play music all though the house love it  this time its a gift for friend fantastic product i use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly the customizable

out to amazon because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use customer service couldnt help they basically told me to contact

had for just one week so far and i can say it is a blast to have love it works like a charm good speaker for bedroom or office small speaker tin sound great with good bluetooth speaker fun and

has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music not sure how i survived with out this for so long echo dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time the sound quality wasnt great but it was inexpensive works great bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house it isnt bad for what it is have issues with it actually playing what i want getting it use

speaker quality is not much better than my iphone x i would spend the extra money to get the fullsize echo which has great sound quality very intelligent love the songs  review i love my echo dot the price i paid during prime day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles but this does so much more i can play music set alarms call friends play games set timersthe list

your entire home like its right out of star trek i named mine computer to get the feel but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems only complaint i have is that the sound quality isnt great i mostly use it for commands though and i have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through i have a couple friends that have a dot and dont mind the audio quality but if youre bothered by that kind of thing id go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers good nice little unit no issues the echo dot was easy to set up and use it helps provide music etc to small spaces and was just what i was looking for i set her up to play through our home theater system so fat we are just using her for weather forecasts cooking timers and we really enjoy the music small device that my kids like to ask questions very handy friendly interactive beyond awesome i like that it responds every time it was easy to set up im still learning what i can do with it i may like a better speaker more family loved it   i like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the google only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker easy to use echos are great i have a few of them through out our home  all in voice range to ask a question say a command to turn lights on or off or my favorite is play

the internet and not the device small size works great in our sunroom i like it and its helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon i reached out to amazon because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use customer service couldnt help they basically told me to contact sprint to assist so echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up so its kind of pointless to have and pay for it wont work as a blue tooth speaker with my tvit connects but wont work ive only got to use it for

location when the app askes is not a good thing try to stay with devices that work directly with the alexa hub with no thirdparty app amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the

structure of the dot the sound is a little too low handy if you dont expect much out of it much dumber than the assistant in my phone its easy to set up and use there are new features and skills added all the time love the product but dislike that i cant sync up my apple music for alexa to play have had for just one week so far and i can say it is a blast to have love it works like a charm good speaker for bedroom or office small speaker tin sound great with good bluetooth speaker fun and information no dislikes so far  like the convenience it was easy to set up and affordable love it i love that i can shut the microphone off at night so my children cant talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music not sure how i survived with out this for so long echo dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time the sound quality wasnt great but it was inexpensive works great bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house it isnt bad for what it is have issues with it actually playing what i want getting it use iheartradio properly by playing the station i want is a challenge but its not bad for the sale price i paid its great but sound quality is very low i love it as always easy to set up it works ok this speaker quality is not much better than my iphone x i would spend the extra money to get the fullsize echo which has great sound quality very intelligent love the songs  review i love my echo dot the price i paid during prime day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles but this does so much more i can play music set alarms call friends play games set timersthe list goes on and on definitely worth the money sound is terrible cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play \n","<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #e4e7d2; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius:

music and tells us the weather it also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning it is better than a clock radio it will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites it can even tell jokes i dont know how i got along without it before now amazing i like the echo but not sure about the dot i use it a lot for music and audio booksthe sound quality of this smaller echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model i havent decided if ill keep it or not love it i got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes we love it better sound got this for my 2nd echo in the house i already have the regular echo the echo dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable wishing i would have just gone with another regular echo solely based on sound i was really happy with my original echo so i thought id get an echo dot to use in my bedroom i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi presumably due to interference from the bluetooth then i connected a speaker via the auxiliary \n","<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #aa9cfc; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius:

i like the hands free operation vs the tap we use both for controlling smart plugs i dislike that it confuses my requests all the time   love my alexa actually have \n","<mark class=\"entity\"

door dead bolt the cameras and i love listening to npr these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek i named mine computer to get the feel but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems only complaint i have is that the sound quality isnt great i mostly use it for commands though and i have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through i have a couple friends that have a dot and dont mind the audio quality but if youre bothered by that kind of thing id go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers
